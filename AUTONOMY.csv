Map	Speaker	Dialogue
Checkpoint_Event1_Page1	Borislav Zsoldos	Get back into the queue, will you?
Checkpoint_Event2_Page1	Soldier	Stay in line, citizen!
Checkpoint_Event3_Page1	Adjutant	Fuck off!
Checkpoint_Event3_Page3	Atlas	There's nothing left for us to do here.
Checkpoint_Event4_Page1	Vova  Kundakçı	He did what?!
Checkpoint_Event6_Page1	Danilo Sala	This is preposterous!
Checkpoint_Event6_Page1	Danilo Sala	I'm a Trachian citizen, you hear me?
Checkpoint_Event7_Page1	Atlas	We don't have time to stroll around.
Checkpoint_Event8_Page1	Artem Blažek	At this point, I don't even know if I'll ever manage to get in...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	What are you looking at?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Is Lieutenant Tanner in?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	What's it to you?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	We have some business to discuss with him.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	He's expecting us.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Yeah?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Not that I would have heard.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	So?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Will you go and fetch him, then?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	I'm afraid not.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	And why's that?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Not allowed to leave my post, unfortunately.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	So we're free to enter?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Can't let that happen.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	I'm getting tired of this.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Sorry, I don't make the rules.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Are you saying we're supposed to wait for him here until he just happens to stroll by?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Well...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	You're not from Trachi, are you?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	How does that matter?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Well...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Get to the point, if you please.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Technically, I could let you in...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	But you'd need a visum first.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Daphne	Preposterous!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Quiet!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Let's say we'd want to acquire one...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Yes?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Who do we talk to?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	The custom's office.... perhaps?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	God, I really have to spell everything out for you, don't I?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	You call that spelling?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	It's like I'm watching a dog trying to do his taxes!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Let's not waste any more time, then.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	As for you...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Atlas	We'll be back.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Can't wait!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page2	Samuil Rybář	What's wrong?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page2	Samuil Rybář	The custom's office is right over there, for heaven's sake!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	Hey, long time no see.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	Let me guess...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	You've lost your way again, haven't you?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	As much as I'd like to personally hold your hand at every step-
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Shut it.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Enough of your bullshit.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Now, you listen to me.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	And listen very carefully.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	I know Tanner is in there.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	And I know that he knows we're here.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	So you either go in there right now and fetch him...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Or I swear I'll drag him out here myself!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	That's what it always comes down to, eh?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Three seconds.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	You Ionians are all the same.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Two.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	But it doesn't matter.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	One.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	He's not here, anyway.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Where is he?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	Like I would know!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	Checking out some place in the forest.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	At least so I heard.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Ganymede	And you couldn't tell us that right away, because?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	I'm sure you've heard this one before...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	But you never asked.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	We're done here.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Samuil Rybář	My thoughts, exactly.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Daphne	Getting a bit uppity, aren't they?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Ganymede	At the very least we get to see a bit more of the countryside.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	We're already behind schedule, as it is.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	But I guess there's no helping it...
Checkpoint_Event10_Page3	Atlas	Let's go.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page4	Samuil Rybář	I've got nothing to say to you.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Samuil Rybář	Look who's back.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Samuil Rybář	You won't believe how much I missed the three of you!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Ganymede	That's rich, coming from someone who literally stands in the same spot the entire day.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Samuil Rybář	You're a funny one!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Samuil Rybář	I thought they'd beat that out of you Shiteonians a long time ago!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Atlas	Enough of that.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Atlas	Is the Lieutenant back?
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Samuil Rybář	Yeah, he's expecting you inside.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Ganymede	At last!
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Atlas	Let's go.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Atlas	We've wasted more than enough time on idle nonfactors.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page5	Samuil Rybář	I'd watch my back in there, if I were you.
Checkpoint_Event10_Page6	Samuil Rybář	I've got nothing more to say to you.
Checkpoint_Event11_Page1	Doroteja Medved	For god's sake...
Checkpoint_Event11_Page1	Doroteja Medved	What the hell is going on?
Checkpoint_Event11_Page2	Klement Stankić	Almost there...
Checkpoint_Event12_Page1	Bohuslav Adam	This charade gives the worst of bureaucracies a run for their money!
Checkpoint_Event12_Page2	Tamara Sokolov	This charade gives the worst of bureaucracies a run for their money!
Checkpoint_Event13_Page1	Elmas Kadeř	Gah! This can't be happening!
Checkpoint_Event17_Page1	Samuil Rybář	Fuck off!
Checkpoint_Event17_Page3	Atlas	There's nothing left for us to do here.
Checkpoint_Event18_Page1	Sebastian Herceg	What to do...
Checkpoint_Event19_Page1	Atlas	We don't have time to stroll around.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page1	Ganymede	Well, that was awkward!
Checkpoint_Event22_Page1	Daphne	This entire situation get's more ridiculous by the minute.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page1	Atlas	Seems that way.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page1	Atlas	But there's a limit to idiosyncratic tolerance.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page1	Atlas	Let's have another word with that cryptic guardsman.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page3	Ganymede	The world's weirdest custom's office, for sure.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page3	Daphne	Seems much more like an asylum for the mentally deranged to me...
Checkpoint_Event22_Page3	Atlas	I think they're far more apt than we give them credit for.
Checkpoint_Event22_Page3	Atlas	In any case, Tanner should be back by now.
Checkpoint_Event24_Page1	Atlas	North: Trachian Demilitarized Zone East: Ionia
Checkpoint_Event24_Page1	Chrysanthos Pololáník	Can I help you, by any chance?
Checkpoint_Event24_Page1	Atlas	Mind pointing us to the barracks?
Checkpoint_Event24_Page1	Chrysanthos Pololáník	Of course!
Checkpoint_Event24_Page1	Chrysanthos Pololáník	It's right over there.
Checkpoint_Event24_Page1	Atlas	Much obliged.
Checkpoint_Event24_Page2	Chrysanthos Pololáník	Have a nice day!
Checkpoint_Event25_Page1	Iosif Cermak	Please calm down, sir.
Checkpoint_Event26_Page1	Mariyka Georgiou	I know, right!?
Checkpoint_Event26_Page1	Mariyka Georgiou	He just left me here and went on his own.
Checkpoint_Event27_Page1	Soldier	Get back into the queue, will you?
Checkpoint_Event30_Page1	Emiliyan Souček	Absolutely fascinating.
Checkpoint_Event30_Page1	Emiliyan Souček	See that crowd?
Checkpoint_Event30_Page1	Emiliyan Souček	Herd mentality at it's finest!
Checkpoint_Event30_Page2	Emiliyan Souček	All it needs is a little spark to light the fire.
Checkpoint_Event31_Page1	Luka Horvat	Move along.
Checkpoint_Event33_Page1	Konstantin Buchvarov	There might be a thunderstorm later.
Checkpoint_Event33_Page1	Konstantin Buchvarov	If I don't get my stuff to a sheltered place, it's all going to be ruined!
Checkpoint_Event34_Page1	Panayiotis Hegedűs	Stay in line, please.
Checkpoint_Event35_Page1	Tarık Martinović	And I'm telling you...
Checkpoint_Event35_Page1	Tarık Martinović	That we don't have any space left in there.
Checkpoint_Event36_Page1	Bartolomeu Marušić	This is ridiculous!
Checkpoint_Event36_Page1	Bartolomeu Marušić	I have an appointment in Trachi at six o' clock, damn you!
Checkpoint_Event38_Page1	Hanife Puga	Is it me or does this queue not move forward, at all?
Checkpoint_Event40_Page1	Daniel Székely	Can I interest you in some dumplings, good Sir?
Checkpoint_Event44_Page1	Albert Barış	Hah!
Checkpoint_Event44_Page1	Albert Barış	No patience these young folks!
Checkpoint_Event46_Page1	Andreu Vadas	Please be patient.
Checkpoint_Event49_Page1	Milovan Nyitrai	Get back into the queue, will you?
Checkpoint_Event51_Page1	Tereza Albu	How dare this brute call a lady like me a witch!
Checkpoint_Event51_Page1	Tereza Albu	Oh, I'll show him, alright!
Checkpoint_Event52_Page1	Kiro Lovász	Two day since I've applied for a permit..
Checkpoint_Event52_Page1	Kiro Lovász	I just want to pass through...
Checkpoint_Event52_Page2	Kiro Lovász	Worst of all, getting out is only going to get harder.
Carriage_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Umm....
Carriage_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Hello?
Carriage_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Glad to have you back!
Carriage_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	We're almost there.
Carriage_Event2_Page1	Atlas	How much longer?
Carriage_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Well...
Carriage_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	If our driver doesn't kill us, beforehand...
Carriage_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	A few minutes, at most.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Don't you guys worry about that!
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I made it more than clear to him that he better not mess this up!
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	A lot of initiative...
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	For a counsellor.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Gladly!
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Anyways...
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	You guys need a brief on anything?
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	We are about to reach our side of the border close to Trachi's eastern checkpoint.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Once we're there, we'll make contact with our man in the republican guard.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Who will hand us the necessary papers to enter the city.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Can't we just go through the main gate?
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Theoretically, yeah.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Though there have been reports that Ionians are being subjected to heavy delays in their passport proceedings.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	So we'd rather not take any chances.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Gotcha!
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Once we're inside, we'll disperse and make our way to the safehouse, individually.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	And support the embassy by gathering intelligence throughout the city.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	It's vital that the negotiations between Trachi and our government proceed without any incidents.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Talks have been deadlocked for the last few weeks, so I heard.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	That is correct.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	And even though we can't be sure what the reason for this is...
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	It's likely that Amryn was involved.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Whatever the case might be, though.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	We're here to change that.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Within the next three days, that is.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	And what if nothing happens by the end of it?
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Let's hope it won't come to that.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Now, I think you're already aware of this.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	But for the record...
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	We're not formally recognized by the committee.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	In other words...
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Once we've crossed the border, we'll be stateless.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Alright.
Carriage_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Let's go.
Barracks_Event1_Page3	Unknown	--- No one hears you desperate knocking sounds ---
Barracks_Event2_Page1	Panagiotakis Samaras	No entry for civilians.
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	So, what now?
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Daphne	We could try another set of passports.
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Though I doubt we'll even get to the first screening today.
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Atlas	If they don't find another reason to deny us again, that is.
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	How about we use the rest of the day to have a look around?
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	And if all else fails, we can still be first in line, tomorrow.
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Atlas	Worth a shot.
Barracks_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Agreed!
Barracks_Event6_Page1	Spartak Kasun	I wonder how the western gate is doing...
Barracks_Event6_Page1	Spartak Kasun	Last I heard there was almost a riot, since some petty noble from Drakon refused to relinquish his weapon.
Barracks_Event6_Page2	Spartak Kasun	He actually had the gall to ask for the "noble's version" of our constitution.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Enjoyed your little stroll around the countryside?
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Considering we're already several hours behind schedule...
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Atlas	I'd rather skip the pleasantries.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Alright, have it your way.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Now, I'm afraid you won't like what I'm going to say next.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Is that so?
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	While I was out in the field, a letter from the Mayor arrived.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Unfortunately, he decided to rescind your invitation to the city.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Daphne	You've got to be kidding me.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	It's the truth, I'm afraid.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Atlas	You do realize you're violating an international agreement?
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Whatever the case might be.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	It's out of my hands.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	You're not barred from entering the city through regular means, of course.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	But I'm afraid this particular route is closed to you.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Now, if there's nothing else to discuss...
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	I must formally ask you to leave Trachian territory.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	Unless you prefer to be escorted from the premises, of course.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Atlas	That won't be necessary.
Barracks_Event7_Page1	Atlas	We'll be going.
Barracks_Event7_Page2	Louis Tanner	Leave.
Barracks_Event8_Page1	Feliks Antić	At the very least they don't have to do with Ionians, man.
Safehouse_Event1_Page1	Ralph Mihaila	Top of the day to you!
Safehouse_Event1_Page2	Ralph Mihaila	Hope you enjoy your stay!
Safehouse_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Over here.
Safehouse_Event1_Page3	Atlas	If you'd be so kind, Ralph.
Safehouse_Event1_Page3	Ralph Mihaila	Of course!
Safehouse_Event1_Page4	Ralph Mihaila	Until next time.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Concierge	Good day, sir!
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	To you as well.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Concierge	How may I help you?
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	This is Archer Street No. 7, right?
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Concierge	Quite so.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	I see.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Concierge	I-i'm not sure I understand...
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	You have the keys for the apartment upstairs?
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Concierge	Y-yes, right here!
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	Good.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	Go ahead, then.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Concierge	It's open.
Safehouse_Event1_Page6	Tillian	After you.
Safehouse_Event3_Page1	Anita De Lange	I'll be right with you.
Safehouse_Event5_Page1	Man	I told you she wouldn't mind!
Safehouse_Event5_Page2	Man	I told you she wouldn't mind!
Safehouse_Event5_Page3	Anita De Lange	I'll be right with you.
Safehouse_Event6_Page1	Jussi Rantanen	Still, though...
Safehouse_Event6_Page1	Jussi Rantanen	I have a feeling I might have to sleep on the couch, for a few days.
Safehouse_Event6_Page2	Anita De Lange	I'll be right with you.
Safehouse_Event7_Page1	Horatio Calvo	Hey there!
Safehouse_Event8_Page1	Petri Janvier	Nothing like a fresh, cold beer to start the day!
Safehouse_Event8_Page2	Petri Janvier	Nothing like a fresh, cold beer to start the day!
Safehouse_Event9_Page2	Daphne	Hm?
Safehouse_Event9_Page2	Daphne	Where the hell is Ralph?
Safehouse_Event9_Page2	Atlas	That's a good question.
Safehouse_Event9_Page2	Atlas	Let's take a look upstairs.
Safehouse_Event9_Page3	Atlas	We still have some business here.
Safehouse_Event10_Page1	Pavel Alberts	If you want to do yourself a favour, try out the fruit salad.
Safehouse_Event16_Page1	Anita De Lange	I'll be right with you.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Dalibor Branko	Good day to you, sir!
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	To you, as well.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	Say, I was wondering if you could help me.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	This is the Elysian, right?
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Dalibor Branko	The one and only.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	Good.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Dalibor Branko	S-sir?
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	You have the keys for the apartment?
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Dalibor Branko	Y-yes, right here!
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	Go ahead.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Dalibor Branko	It's open.
Safehouse_Event17_Page1	Atlas	After you.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event2_Page1	Miron Demetriou	I hope we'll meet again next year!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	It's got to be in here, somewhere...
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	There we go!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Excuse me.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	I'll be with you in a second!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Put this here...
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	That goes there...
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	And we're set!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Sorry for the delay, madam.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Daphne?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Is that you?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Yep.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	That time of the year again?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Time surely flies...
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	I'm sorry.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	It's alright.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	How is he?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	The usual, from what I've heard.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Though I'm sure your judgement is far better than mine in that respect.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	You're here to see him?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Very well.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	He's in the western wing right now.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Down the hall to your left.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Do you want someone to accompany you?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	That won't be necessary.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I'll be on my way, then.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Alright.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Just need you to sign this and you're good to go.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Thank you very much!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Miron Demetriou	Was nice seeing you again!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Likewise!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	Good day to you.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Daphne	And to you.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	How can I help you?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I'm here to speak to Mr. Patterson.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	Oh!
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	You are Mrs. "Daphne"?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Daphne	That's right.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	Mr. Sobol?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	The young lady here has an appointment with Mr.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	Patterson.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Miron Demetriou	Would you mind escorting her to his room?
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Dalibor Sobol	Sure.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event3_Page3	Dalibor Sobol	After me, if you'd be so kind.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event5_Page1	Halim Ardelean	I'm afraid this area is restricted.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event6_Page1	Dalibor Sobol	Sorry Ma'am, no entry for visitors.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event8_Page1	Stelian Vasile	Please talk to the receptionist if you have a request.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event10_Page1	Leonard Isaev	I honestly don't know how many more twelve-hour shifts I can take...
Wenger Sanatorium_Event11_Page1	Dalibor Sobol	Sorry madam, no entry for visitors.
Wenger Sanatorium_Event15_Page1	Miron Demetriou	I hope we'll meet again next year!
Debug_Event2_Page3	Unknown	DANIEL PRESTON
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Much better.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Okay, so here's the deal...
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	I bought us around two and a half minutes.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Enough for a little chat!
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	When the music stops...
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	I'll probably wake up.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Until then, I'll answer your questions.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	So go ahead.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Bit of an open question, isn't it?
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	And honestly, I think you're a better judge than me.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Right, right.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	I don't have to pull that kind of shit with you, I forgot.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	After all, you can't harm me... right?
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	There's a barrier between us.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Some might say I'm fiction.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Then again, what are you to me?
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Hm, I've been wondering about that, too.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Probably a place I created.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Another level in an unending amount of layers.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	It's a bit hard to comprehend, isn't it?
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	That's why we like to put things into boxes, I guess.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Uhm...
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	I guess so.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	No hard feelings, though.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	She's just playing her part.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	And I'm playing mine.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	It's funny, really.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Knowing you have no control about it...
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Can make things a lot more bearable.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Aww!
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Or we can just stare at each other until our time is up.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	But who am I kidding.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Maybe I'm just talking to myself, after all.
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Really?
Debug_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	You wanna leave, already?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	Not this time.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Finally.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Yo!
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	You there?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Sorry.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	That was a trick question.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	But I'm glad you can hear me.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Shit...
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	She's already breaking through.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I don't know how long I can keep this up.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	So I'll make this quick.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It's important that we talk.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And since this is as good an opportunity as any...
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I might just try and see if this works.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Alright, here we go!
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Much better.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Okay, so here's the deal...
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I bought us around two and a half minutes.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Enough for a little chat!
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	When the music stops...
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I'll probably wake up.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Until then, I'll answer your questions.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	So go ahead.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Alright.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Looks like we're out of time.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It was fun, though.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And I hope we can do it again!
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Ask away.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Bit of an open question, isn't it?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And honestly, I think you're a better judge than me.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Right, right.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I don't have to pull that kind of shit with you, I forgot.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	After all, you can't harm me... right?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	There's a barrier between us.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Some might say I'm fiction.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Then again, what are you to me?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Hm, I've been wondering about that, too.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Probably a place I created.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Another level in an unending amount of layers.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It's a bit hard to comprehend, isn't it?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	That's why we like to put things into boxes, I guess.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Uhm...
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I guess so.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	No hard feelings, though.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	She's just playing her part.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And I'm playing mine.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It's funny, really.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Knowing you have no control about it...
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Can make things a lot more bearable.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Aww!
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Or we can just stare at each other until our time is up.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	But who am I kidding.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Maybe I'm just talking to myself, after all.
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Really?
Debug_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	You wanna leave, already?
Debug_Event9_Page1	Icarus	Here we go.
Debug_Event9_Page1	Ganymede	Let's hope this works.
Debug_Event9_Page1	General Forten	What's the meaning of this?
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	Sir!
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	Please stay inside the carriage!
Debug_Event9_Page1	General Forten	Nonsense!
Debug_Event9_Page1	General Forten	Why did we stop?
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	There's a cart blocking the road, sir.
Debug_Event9_Page1	General Forten	Then move it!
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	Working on it, sir!
Debug_Event9_Page1	Icarus	Come on...
Debug_Event9_Page1	Icarus	What's he waiting for?
Debug_Event9_Page1	Ganymede	He'll do it, don't worry.
Debug_Event9_Page1	General Forten	Is there a problem?
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	Sorry Sir!
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	We'll have the road cleared, momentarily!
Debug_Event9_Page1	Soldier	Hold it!
Debug_Event9_Page2	Icarus	Here we go.
Debug_Event9_Page2	Ganymede	Let's hope this works.
Debug_Event9_Page2	General Forten	What's the meaning of this?
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	Sir!
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	Please stay inside the carriage!
Debug_Event9_Page2	General Forten	Nonsense!
Debug_Event9_Page2	General Forten	Why did we stop?
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	There's a cart blocking the road, sir.
Debug_Event9_Page2	General Forten	Then move it!
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	Working on it, sir!
Debug_Event9_Page2	Icarus	Come on...
Debug_Event9_Page2	Icarus	What's he waiting for?
Debug_Event9_Page2	Ganymede	He'll do it, don't worry.
Debug_Event9_Page2	General Forten	Is there a problem?
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	Sorry Sir!
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	We'll have the road cleared, momentarily!
Debug_Event9_Page2	Soldier	Hold it!
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	What the fuck?
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	Did you hear that?
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	\nr<Guardsman>Yeah.
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	\nr<Guardsman>I'll go and check it out.
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	Yo!
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	Everything alright over there?
Debug_Event11_Page1	Guardsman	Kenny?
Debug_Event11_Page1	Militia	Hold it!
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	What do you want?
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	Sorry, but I'm not for sale.
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	You've grown up.
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	I'm proud.
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	And you.
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	Aww...
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	Alright.
Debug_Event22_Page1	Preston	Have at you.
Debug_Event25_Page1	Preston	\fbT\fbest
Debug_Event25_Page1	Guardsman	Did you hear that?
Debug_Event25_Page1	A\C[0]\fbtlas	Yep.
Debug_Event25_Page3	Atlas	You guys clear on everything?
Debug_Event27_Page1	Atlas	Test Yes Test No
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	W-what?
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	W-where am I?
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	I can't see.
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	Oh god...
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	Hey!!
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	Someone!
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	Get me out!
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	Someone help me...
Debug_Event27_Page1	Girl	PLEASE!!!
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	W-what?
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	W-where am I?
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	Oh god...
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	Hey!!
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	Someone there?!
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	Get me out!
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	Help me...
Debug_Event27_Page2	Girl	PLEASE!!!
Debug_Event27_Page3	Daphne	Watch me.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	Áron.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	Gregory.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	I'm glad you made it.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	Right.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	Where's Eury?
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	Should be here, any moment, now.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	What about Daphne?
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	She's hard to predict.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	But I think we got her cornered.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	And the other one?
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	Ganymede, you mean?
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	Yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	I told him what he needed to hear.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	But everything beyond that...
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	Your guess is better than mine.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	Hm.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Gregory Lorentz	You know I haven't seen him in years.
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	Yeah...
Debug_Event28_Page1	Atlas	But some people never change.
Debug_Event28_Page3	???	...
Debug_Event28_Page3	???	I see.
Debug_Event28_Page3	???	We need a keep a close watch on him, in any case.
Debug_Event28_Page3	???	Seeing as their methods tend to be rather unorthodox at times...
Debug_Event28_Page3	???	This might just be another elaborate deception.
Debug_Event28_Page3	???	Enter.
Debug_Event28_Page4	Secretary	Sorry to interrupt.
Debug_Event28_Page4	Secretary	Mr. Franklin is here to see you.
Debug_Event28_Page4	???	I see.
Debug_Event28_Page4	???	I'll be with him in a minute.
Debug_Event28_Page4	???	Could you prepare him a cup of tea in mean-
Debug_Event28_Page4	???	time?
Debug_Event28_Page4	Secretary	Right away, sir.
Debug_Event28_Page5	???	Thank you for your report.
Debug_Event28_Page5	???	Keep me appraised on any furher movements.
Debug_Event28_Page5	Adjutant	Understood, Sir!
Debug_Event28_Page5	???	Oh, one more thing.
Debug_Event28_Page5	???	Give my regards to Jerry, will you?
Debug_Event28_Page5	???	He's to keep an eye on that woman at all times, no matter what.
Debug_Event28_Page5	???	If my guess is right, she'll lead us straight to them.
Debug_Event28_Page5	Adjutant	Acknowledged, sir!
Debug_Event28_Page6	???	Good to see you again, Klaus.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Likewise, friend.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	How have you been?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	As well as the circumstances allow, I guess.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	You're not enjoying your new position?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Don't get me wrong...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	It's major step up, for sure.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	But I wonder whether it isn't too much, too soon.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	I'm not sure if it's a bit early.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Don't worry too much about it.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	We all have to start somewhere.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Can't argue with that.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Anyways, you wanted to see me?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Indeed.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	There's something I think you should know.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Go ahead.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Have you heard of the body the police found this morning?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	It's a tragedy.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	The Guard tried to identify the corpse.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	And they found some papers on it.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Apparently, the body belongs to a man named Rupert Sternlein.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Is that so?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Has the cause of death been announced?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Not yet.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	But there are rumors.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Such as?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Some people in the guard say that he died from internal bleeding.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Caused by a wound from a small blade.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Apart from that, the body is supposedly in good shape.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	I see.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	There's more, though.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Right after they identified the body, the Guard had sent someone to his place in order to break the news to his wife and two children.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Curiously enough, when the guardsmen arrived, no one was at home.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Did they search his place, yet?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Nope.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	There's some red tape they have to go through, first.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Unlike them to care for such things...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	It is curious, I agree...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	But I would assume the recent incidents has left the Guard spread incredibly thin.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Even more so when it comes to people the mayor trusts.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Right...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Have we heard from our man, yet?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	He's off duty, at the moment.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Poor guy spent the last eighteen hours chasing after Ionians and their entourage.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Was he able to confirm the identity of the one they caught yesterday?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Yeah, it's one of them, no doubt.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	I gotta say, though...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	That was some uncanny foresight you showed there.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Wasn't much of feat, to be honest.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Hyperion is a dangerous man, but he's also grown somewhat predictable lately.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Besides, we knew they'd hit the place sooner or later.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Even though I wouldn't have expected them to try and activate the asset that soon.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Looks like their negotiations with the mayor didn't go as planned.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	It seems that way, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	The man they held in custody...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Did they get anything valuable out of him?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Not from what I know.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	But Tanner took it upon himself to conduct the inter-
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	view.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Interesting...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Did they follow him?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	He met a woman in Anderson Park.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Together, they went to a house in Rondham.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	A bunch of guardsmen sweeped the place, a few hours ago.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	But from what I heard, they cleaned the place pretty thoroughly.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	What about the operatives?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	No trace of them.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	I figured as much...
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	Why's that?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	There's a hidden exit, leading into the sewers.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	I see!
Debug_Event28_Page6	Klaus	You want me to leak this to the Guard?
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	Not yet.
Debug_Event28_Page6	Hector	I want to verify something first.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	How's the situation?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Well...
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	There's a couple of wounded, five people dead, at least.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	At least as far as the Guard is concerned.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	Anybody know who fired the first shot?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	There's a lot of rumors.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	But most of them heard a pistol being discharged from a window in the second floor.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	Hm.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	As bad as it sounds, though...
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	We probably got lucky, there.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	If it weren't for the shootout...
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	We might've actually lost the entire city, right there.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	Maybe, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	But then again, we haven't won yet, either.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	How many men do they in Rondham?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Doubt it's any more than thirty of fourty.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	These are mostly militia from Nestville, right?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Yup.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Though most of them are former Guardsmen.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	And Heinrich trained them very well.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	What about Tanner?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Only suffered a few minor injuries.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	Can he walk?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	I don't know.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Want me to check up on him?
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	If you don't mind.
Debug_Event28_Page7	Tillian	Alright, will do!
Debug_Event28_Page7	Gregor Lorentz	Thank you.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	What the hell?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	Tillian?!
Debug_Event28_Page9	Tillian	Took you long enough.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Tillian	Did you have another sightseeing trip or what?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	I knew there was something off about you.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	You little shit.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Hector	Please.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Hector	There is no need for this.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	And you...
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	Cerberus.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	You're working for them full-time now?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	Sometimes a man has to follow his own heart.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	But I haven't called you all the way here just to reminisce.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	Your associate.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	I think Ganymede was his name?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	He's on his way back to Ionia?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	You set him up, didn't you?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	I contributed to it.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	A lot of people were involved in order to make it happen.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	What are you implying?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Cerberus	Atlas?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	What?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	It's true.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	You've gotta be kidding me.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	I'm sorry, Daphne.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	I wish I could tell you that I had no choice.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	But this time, I did.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	And as much as I regret it...
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	I would do it again.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	You sold him out.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	I did.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	But why?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Because he was in the way.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	Of what?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Do you know a man named Crius?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	The undersecretary?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	He ordered Ganymede to watch us.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Both of us, that is.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	To what purpose?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Because he's aiming to become secretary.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	By taking down Hyperion?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Precisely.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	It's important to him that this operation is unsuccesful.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	All of this just to move up a chair?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Just like us.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Hyperion has made a lot of enemies lately.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	And you?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	I'm one them, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Daphne	So why not work with Crius?
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	We did, for a time.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	But recently, our goals diverged.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	I didn't do all of this just to play politics.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Crius wants a promotion.
Debug_Event28_Page9	Atlas	Whereas I intend to tear the entire structure down.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Took you long enough.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	And you were faster than I had expected.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I assume you found out about it, then?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	To be fair...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	It wasn't that hard to put the pieces together.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	How long have you been investigating him?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Pretty much from the moment he defected to us.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Figures...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	And you've been tracking me, as well?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I see.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	What about Eurydice?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I don't think I have to tell you that.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	If I am to guess, she'll come walking through that door within the next minutes, as well.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	From the moment he defected to us.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Figures...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I'm not sure how you pulled that one of.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	But I'm quite honestly impressed.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You've been busy.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	And you.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	So...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	What's it gonna be?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I kill you, you kill me?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Pretty confident of you.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Hm...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I guess you want to talk, beforehand?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	About a couple of things, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Well, I'm not really a fan of getting interviewed.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Then let me do the talking.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Oh?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Go ahead then.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	See if those tricks of yours work on me.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I'm not here to pressure you into something.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Yes, yes.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	We've all heard that line more times than any of us can stomach.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Just get to the point, please.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Alright.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I think you're well aware of the things my people have done.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Standing right next to the result of one of your recent ventures, I can attest to that.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I want your help in tearing it down.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	What exactly?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Amryn.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Trachi.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Ionia.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	They all need to go.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I'm afraid I don't follow.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You know I've done horrible, unspeakable things.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Not that I'm super exceptional.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	In some wicked sense, I just happen to be really good at something that is terribly wrong.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But I'd rather have a world in which I'm useless.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Than thrive in one that incorporates so much human-made misery.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Terribly touching.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	But I'm afraid I don't really buy it.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	These are Eury's words.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Oh?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	That makes it even worse.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	In any case...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I'm not one for long speeches.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	So I'll get to the point.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You lived in Nestville for more than a year.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You saw what a world untouched by people like us can look like.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	So what are you proposing?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You're aware that no matter what you might have up your sleeve...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	This city is lost to you.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	What do you mean by that?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Me and Eurydice have been working closely with the leader of the TLF.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I am aware of that.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	You were so kind as to give us a reason to finally fight this out on a battlefield.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	And if your intelligence is even half their reputation's worth, you know that you'll have no chance of winning a war.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You're right.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Ionia will surely lose.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Ionia will undoubtedly lose.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	However, Amryn is very likely to suffer heavy casualties.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Every strip of land along the border has been heavily fortified.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	The Promeria is being turned into one big minefield while we're speaking.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Even so.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	You can't say that this is a win for you.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	That depends on the objective.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Naturally, I helped Ionia along some steps.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But then again, you made good use of the information I gave you, as well.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Oh?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Now that is rich.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	You're claiming that you are responsible for the leak?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Me and a few others, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	To what end?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	To stall Ionia.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	In order for our plan to succeed, neither side was allowed to gain control over the city.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	What plan?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Eurydice likes to call it a revolution.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But I'm much more reserved.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Right now, we're nothing but dissidents.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But we do have a fighting chance.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	You're insane.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	There's no way the locals will acept that.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Not after all the shit you've done to them.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Maybe.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But as far as they're concerned, I'm dead.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	And the same goes for the IIB.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Pretty risky for you to come here, then.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	It is.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But it's also important for you to know the truth.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	The truth, yeah?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I still don't buy it.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I expected as much.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You'll be leaving the city soon, I assume?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	None of your business.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Alright.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	In any case, if you change your mind...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You know how to contact us.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Wait!
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	When did you find out?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Since yesterday evening.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Are you saying...?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Yes, I've witnessed it.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	So...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Nothing else you have to say about it?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Like what?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Of course...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	You were the one who leaked Clara's location to us, in the first place.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Correct.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	But you didn't expect me to do what I did, right?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	No.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	So why didn't you stop me?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	I arrived when you stowed her body back inside.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Which leads me to the question of what exactly happened, there.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	It was an accident.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I went to the place described on the note.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	And found the spot where the girl was stashed.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Some of the rainwater had already leaked into the pipe.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	That was part of your plan, right?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Those were the orders, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Control wanted us to bring about a sense of... urgency.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I see...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	In any case though...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	When I saw the state of things, I was left with a choice.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	This man, right here.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	He wanted me to return the girl to the mayor.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Those were my official orders.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Those were my official orders.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	He wanted me to return the girl to the mayor.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Those were the orders, yeah.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	That was part of your plan, right?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Because there's a part of me that would've done the same.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	And it served your purpose, after all.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Call it a win-win.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Even for the girl?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	No.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Do you regret it, then?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Does it ever get any easier?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Unfortunately, it does.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Which is why it's important for us realize that things like these can't go on any longer.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You see, the man next to you...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You see, the man next to you...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Don't dig to deep, Atlas.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	But why?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	To you, specifically.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	Then see it for yourself.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	To what end?
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Alright.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I think I've heard enough.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You know, she told me about you...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	You know, she told me about you...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	May he rest in piece.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	I'm sorry.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Well, congratulations.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Well, congratulations.
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But that's not all
Debug_Event28_Page11	Tillian	Let me get this right...
Debug_Event28_Page11	Atlas	But for that to happen...
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	I gotta say...
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	You really had a lot of us fooled...
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	What do you mean by that?
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	I know you've been in contact with him.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	That was a long time ago.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	And I told the service about that when I crossed over.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	I'm not referring to that.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	Did you know he was the one who tipped us off about Glundon?
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	I suspected as much.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	But I had no proof.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	And you still took the bait.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	Which means you're either stupid...
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	Or not on our side, after all.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	What are you implying?
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	The secretary saw you leave the building last night.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	Atlas, who had meanwhile briefly been to the safehouse, leaves around ten minutes later.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	And the next morning, one of our most valuable assetts is found drifting in the sewers.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	Now, I don't have any proof, nor do I know what exactly happened...
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	But you've got to admit that this doesn't put you in a good light.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	What are you implying?
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	I don't for sure.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	How about you tell me?
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	What where you doing yesterday when you went out?
Debug_Event28_Page12	???	Go ahead.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Atlas	Tell him.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	You're early, as always.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Atlas	Don't change the subject.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	What's the meaning of this?
Debug_Event28_Page12	Tillian	Explain yourself!
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	You're a bright one, Tillian.
Debug_Event28_Page12	Hector	I'm sure you've got it all figured out, by now.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Daphne	What the hell?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Daphne	Tillian?!
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Took you long enough.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Did you have another sightseeing trip or what?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Daphne	I knew there was something off about you.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Daphne	You little shit.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	Please.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	There is no need for this.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	What do you mean by that?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	I know you've been in contact with him.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	That was a long time ago.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	And I told the service about that when I crossed over.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	I'm not referring to that.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Did you know he was the one who tipped us off about Glundon?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	I suspected as much.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	But I had no proof.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	And you still took the bait.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Which means you're either stupid...
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Or not on our side, after all.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	What are you implying?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	The secretary saw you leave the building last night.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Atlas, who had meanwhile briefly been to the safehouse, leaves around ten minutes later.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	And the next morning, one of our most valuable assetts is found drifting in the sewers.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Now, I don't have any proof, nor do I know what exactly happened...
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	But you've got to admit that this doesn't put you in a good light.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	What are you implying?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	I don't for sure.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	How about you tell me?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	What where you doing yesterday when you went out?
Debug_Event29_Page2	???	Go ahead.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Tell him.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	You're early, as always.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Don't change the subject.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	What's the meaning of this?
Debug_Event29_Page2	Tillian	Explain yourself!
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	You're a bright one, Tillian.
Debug_Event29_Page2	Hector	I'm sure you've got it all figured out, by now.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Tillian	So you're telling me the three of you have been working together, this entire time?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	In some sense, yeah.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	You see, the fact that our profession exists is symptomatic of a certain type of society.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	However, we cannot simply put the blame on the average individual.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	We're supposed to be watchmen and enforcers.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	But recently, we've become the judges, as well.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Tillian	What's your point?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	His point is...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	We can't simply go on like this.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	There's a war about to happen.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	And as much we hate to admit it...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	We're the among the people to blame for it.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	Of course, we can't stop it by ourselves.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	However, we can at least do something right.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	The three of us.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	Cerberus.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	Eurydice.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	And me.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	We all have prepared a full account of everything we've done in the course of our careers.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	Tomorrow morning, these confession will be sent to all the publishers across the continent.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Tillian	Are you shitting me?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Tillian	You set all of this up...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Tillian	Just because you can't take the heat?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Tillian	And you seriously think it's going to make a change?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	Who knows.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	But one thing's for sure...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Hector	The people deserve to know what's going on.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	You guys are insane.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	If you want to throw your lives away, then go ahead!
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	But do you realize...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	How many people you're going to get killed?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	Yeah.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	But there's no other way.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	I can't believe you...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	Not content to put me through hell once, are you?
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	No.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	Once again...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	You take everything that is dear to me...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	And grind it into dust.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Atlas	I'm sorry, Daphne.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	There's no need to apologize.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	You're just doing what's best for yourself.
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	But you know what...
Debug_Event29_Page3	Daphne	Two can play that game.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Daphne	Damn.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Daphne	I missed.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Orpheus	Eury...
Debug_Event30_Page1	Orpheus	I'll go and fetch a doctor.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	Don't bother.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	I think I'm done for.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Don't say that.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Atlas	I refuse to let you go.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	It's a bit late for that, isn't it?
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	But I do appreciate the sentiment.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Stop the melodramatic bullshit, already.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Atlas	You'll live, you hear me?!
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	Thank you for everything, the two of you.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	And don't worry about me, too much.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Eurydice	Because I can finally apoligize to her.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Orpheus	Atlas!
Debug_Event30_Page1	Orpheus	Don't.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Orpheus	We'll need her.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Atlas	You're right.
Debug_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Don't wait for me.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Unknown	* Locked * * Locked *
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	Are you listening to me?
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	This guy is insane!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>You don't say!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>Could be the reason why he's in here, don't you think?
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	I get that, of course!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	But the whole thing... this place here.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	It's getting to me.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	That's all I'm saying!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>Well, if you're that unhappy...
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>They can always use a strong pair of hands in one of the labour camps.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	I-i didn't mean...
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>I'm kidding, for god's sake!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Ahem!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>Can I help you?
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	I have an appointment with Mr. Patterson.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>Right.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>You heard the lady.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	\nr<İlyas Genadiev>Get a move on!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	Yessir!
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	If you'd come with me, please.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Stamatis Iordanou	He's all yours.
Western Hallway_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Thank you.
Outskirts_Event1_Page1	Unknown	Please be advised that you are leaving the Trachian administrative area.
Outskirts_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So, where to?
Outskirts_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Forest shouldn't be far.
Outskirts_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Northeast, I think?
Outskirts_Event6_Page1	Herman Dimov	Sorry Sir, no entry from this side.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Herman Dimov	South: Trachi North: Nestville
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	Sorry sir...
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	But this area is closed off, at the moment.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	That's the road to Nestville, right?
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	What's left of it, anyway.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	What happened?
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	Well...
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	I'm not really authorized to speak about that.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	We're doing our best to get the situation back under control, though!
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Mind if we take a look ourselves?
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	As I said, the area's quite "precarious".
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	I'd strongly advise you to turn around, while you have the chance.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Note taken.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Now, would you move aside, please?
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	Can't you take a hint?
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	This is for your own good!
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	You're awfully pushy for someone claiming to offer advice.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	I'm just trying to talk sense into you.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	And we appreciate that.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	But if you don't move out of the way immediately...
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	I'll make you.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	Alright, I get it.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Marcus Csorba	If you're so keen on hurting yourself, be my guest.
Outskirts_Event8_Page1	Atlas	We've got to be somewhere anyway.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	You again?
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	That's the road to Nestville, right?
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	What's left of it, anyway.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	What happened?
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	Well...
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	I'm not really authorized to speak about that.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	We're doing our best to get the situation back under control, though!
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	Mind if we take a look ourselves?
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	As I said, the area's quite "precarious".
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	I'd strongly advise you to turn around, while you have the chance.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	Note taken.

Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	Can't you take a hint?
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	This is for your own good!
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	You're awfully pushy for someone claiming to offer advice.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	I'm just trying to talk sense into you.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	And we appreciate that.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	But if you don't move out of the way immediately...
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	I'll make you.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	Alright, I get it.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Marcus Csorba	If you're so keen on hurting yourself, be my guest.
Outskirts_Event8_Page2	Atlas	This is going nowhere.
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	What an odd fellow!
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Daphne	Eccentric to say the least!
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Daphne	Though I bet he's far more gentle and soft towards the forest's inhabitants! ♥
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	I wonder what his deal with Tanner is...
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Nothing that should concern us, in any case.
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Atlas	Let's get a move on.
Outskirts_Event10_Page1	Atlas	We have to be inside the city by dusk.
Outskirts_Event10_Page2	Ganymede	That was surprisingly productive!
Outskirts_Event10_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Outskirts_Event10_Page2	Atlas	Northwards, then.
Outskirts_Event11_Page2	Marcus Csorba	Get a move on, then.
Outskirts_Event14_Page1	Şenol Dragić	Word is, there's been a brawl in the parliament last session.
Outskirts_Event14_Page1	Şenol Dragić	Can you believe that?
Outskirts_Event14_Page2	Şenol Dragić	What's the world coming to?
Outskirts_Event15_Page1	Ljupčo Horvat	You people heading north?
Outskirts_Event15_Page1	Atlas	That's none of your business.
Outskirts_Event15_Page1	Ljupčo Horvat	Easy there!
Outskirts_Event15_Page1	Ljupčo Horvat	Just wanted to give you some friendly advice, that's all!
Outskirts_Event15_Page1	Ljupčo Horvat	There's some scum out and about, lately.
Outskirts_Event15_Page1	Ljupčo Horvat	So I'd better watch my back, if I were you.
Outskirts_Event15_Page2	Ljupčo Horvat	Be careful out there, will ya?
Outskirts_Event17_Page1	Dejana Stefanov	Do you have a fever or something?
Outskirts_Event18_Page1	Seyyit Vasilescu	Don't you worry my dear!
Outskirts_Event18_Page1	Seyyit Vasilescu	I can handle a bunch of brigands without breaking a sweat!
Outskirts_Event18_Page2	Seyyit Vasilescu	I never felt better in my entire life!
Outskirts_Event19_Page2	Kenneth Horvat	Come on, Kenneth...
Outskirts_Event19_Page2	Kenneth Horvat	You can do this!
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Kenneth Horvat	Yo!
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Kenneth Horvat	It's you lot again.
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Atlas	Yeah.
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Atlas	We'll talk to him.
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Kenneth Horvat	Thank you!
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Kenneth Horvat	I knew you'd come around!
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Atlas	Are you going to let us through?
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Kenneth Horvat	Oh, right!
Outskirts_Event19_Page3	Kenneth Horvat	Sorry!
Outskirts_Event20_Page1	Judit Kovalchuk	What's really out there?
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	Alright, lads.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	This is it.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	We'll wait for the signal.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	And these assholes to fuck off.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	Once the coast is clear...
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	We go in.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	And get Julius out.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	Check your weapons.
Outskirts_Event24_Page1	Zlatan Sokol	Shoot to kill.
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	Hey, you there!
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	Mind doing me a favour, real quick?
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Atlas	Sorry.
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Atlas	But we're just passing through.
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	It'll only take a minute!
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	There's this lad living in that cabin, over there.
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	My job's to check up on him...
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	But he keeps telling me to sod off.
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Atlas	So?
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	Come on, guys...
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	My career's on the line here, damn it!
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Atlas	Sounds like a you problem to me.
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	Fine!
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	I'll just do it, myself!
Outskirts_Event26_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	Not like I'm scared of that cranky old bugger, anyway!
Outskirts_Event27_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	Thank you, guys.
Outskirts_Event27_Page1	Kenneth Horvat	I really appreciate it!
Gany's room 1927_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	About time.
Gany's room 1927_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Is it time?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	You're here.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Yup.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Third time's the charm, huh?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	So...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	What's on the menu?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Mind if I come in?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Be my guest.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	How are you holding up?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Alright, I guess.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Some days are better, others are worse.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Time seems to pass a lot quicker, though.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Think I'm finally getting used to it.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I guess that makes two of us, hm?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Sorry.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I haven't been talking to people a lot, lately.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Even Dr. Andreos?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Stopped seeing me around three months ago.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Why?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	He got what he wanted.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I told him the entire thing.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Funny, isn't it?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Three years in Tartarus...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Just like that.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	So it was you, after all.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	What do you mean?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Fero got arrested, last month.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Treason?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Yup.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Hm.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	He had it coming, I guess.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	On that note...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I think I owe you an apology.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Don't worry about it.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	You did what you thought was right.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Just like the rest of us.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	In any case...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I can arrange for you to see someone else, if you want.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Someone who can keep his mouth shut.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	You don't get it, do you?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	It doesn't matter who I talk to.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I've played my part.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	The rest is up to you.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Gany-
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	That's not my name, anymore!
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Bullshit!
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Listen...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I can't even begin to comprehend the things you must've gone through.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	But you know this isn't the end of the road for you!
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	You're gonna do it?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I have to, don't I?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Because of him?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	And because of you.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Do me a favour, will you?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Drop that in a bin on your way out.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I can't do that.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Hm.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I can't force you to read it.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	And frankly, I'd like to leave the choice to you, anyway.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	But if you're going along with this...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Please, do it soon.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	And if I don't?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	You might be the one to visit me, next time.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I see.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	You got my word.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Thank you.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I'll be going, then.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Daph?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Yeah?
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	If you know what's good for you...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	You better pray that they'll never let me leave this place.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	Hm.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Daphne	I guess we'll see about that.
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Man...
Gany's room 1927_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Can this guy get himself a typewriter, already?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Yeah?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	What do you want?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	That's a nice uniform you have on display over there.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	From what I know, you're normally not allowed to keep those.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Some people have a hard time letting go.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	But I doubt that you're here to discuss memorabilia.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Right.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	There's a man named Heinrich.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	A former member of the guard.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Who told you about him?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Does the name Julius Gaston ring any bells?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	That old fool is still around?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Partly, yeah.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	He's been apprehended by the Guard, an hour ago.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Happens to a lot of people these days.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	He's always been too eager for his own good.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	But that too, is not the reason why you're here.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Right?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	We need to get inside Trachi.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Today.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	You sure about that?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	I'd rather get as far away as possible, if I were you.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	It's not for us to decide.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Well, I can't help you with that.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	But there's a small community up north.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Tell them I sent you.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Don't know if anything good comes from it...
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	But seeing as you're here...
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	It's probably your best shot.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Thank you for your help.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Don't mention it!
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Now, if you'd excuse me, I'd rather not be involved any more than necessary.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Of course.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	We're looking for Lieutenant Tanner.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Have you seen him, by any chance?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Not in a long time, no.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	And frankly, he might as well smolder in the deepest depths of hell, for all I care.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Thank you for your time, regardless.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	That's a nice uniform you have on display over there.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	From what I know, you're usually not allowed to keep those.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Some people have a hard time letting go.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	But I doubt that you're here to discuss memorabilia.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Right.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	There's a man named Heinrich.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	A former member of the guard.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Who told you about him?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Does the name Julius Gaston ring any bells?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	That old fool is still around?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Partly, yes.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	He was apprehended by the Guard, an hour ago.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Happens to a lot of people these days.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	He's always been too eager for his own good.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	But he's not the reason you're here, right?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	We need to enter the city.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Today, that is.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	You sure about that?
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	I'd rather get as far away as possible, if I were you.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	It's not for us to decide.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Well, I can't help you with that.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	But there's a small community up north, called Nestville.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Tell them that I sent you.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Don't know if anything good comes from it...
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	But seeing as you're here...
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	It's probably your best shot.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Thank you for your help.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Don't mention it!
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	Now, if you'd excuse me, I'd rather not be involved any more than necessary.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Of course.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	We're done.
Heinrich's Hut_Event1_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	We're done.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Can we stop here for a second?
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	If we have to.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	There's a question I want to ask.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Go ahead.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	I understand we have to keep a low profile.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	But we are still in the DMZ right?
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Correct.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	So why let this guy act like he owns the place?
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	He's still our best lead into the city.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	And an important figure beyond that, as well.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	That's why we have to cooperate, for now.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	I see.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	You think he'll keep his word?
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Maybe.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	But he knows what's at stake.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	That's not what you wanted to ask me, though, right?
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Right.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	See, I might be wrong on that.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	But he's awfully well informed.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	And well connected.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	The way you two looked at each other...
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	As if you've met before.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Now, I'm not gonna pry.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	But he might exploit this, given the chance.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Your point?
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	What I'm trying to say is: We don't have a lot of friends out here, as you mentioned.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Just the three of us to watch each other's back.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	I'm not sure if that's an assurance or a threat...
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	But I appreciate the sentiment.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Daphne	I'd hate to interrupt your little bonding session.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Daphne	But there's a custom's office I'd like to have another look at.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Daphne	If you guys don't mind, of course!
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Good idea.
Woods_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Let's go.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	HEY!
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	What do you think you're doing here?
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	This area's not safe for civilians.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And why's that?
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	We're in the middle of an investigation here.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	Though we have the situation fully under control, we can't be sure if there's still someone at large.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Is Lieutenant Tanner on site?
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	That's no concern of yours.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Answer the question, please.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	As I said.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	It's none of your business.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	So you either vacate this place...
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	Or I'll have to remove you by force.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Not until you've told me where your acting officer is.
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	This is your last warning!
Glade_Event2_Page2	Flórián Dragović	Piss off!
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	What's going on here!?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Flórián Dragović	S-sir!
Glade_Event3_Page2	Flórián Dragović	I was just telling this civilian to leave.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	That I heard.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	You may stand down.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	I'll take it from here.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	Now, I gather there's some kind of disagreement?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Nothing that can't be solved.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	We're looking for Lieutenant Tanner.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	I see.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	Well, you found him.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Good.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	So, what's your business with me?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	For starters...
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Mind explaining why you're not at your post?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	Come again?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Drop the pretense.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	You know exactly who we are and why we're here!
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	You're a bit early, aren't you?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	I don't like to repeat myself.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	Yes, yes!
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	I'm very sorry about the delay.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	And promise I'll be with you as soon as our investigation is concluded.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	This is not up for debate.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	And by the way: You and your men shouldn't be in the demilitarized zone, anyway.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	You're right about that.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	But here we are.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	And we won't leave until we're finished.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	You could make a fuss over it, of course.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	I'm sure there's a lot of people on both sides eagerly waiting for someone to lose his temper.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	Or two of us could work together like we're supposed to.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	What's it going to be?
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	You've got ten minutes.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	Glad we could come to an agreement.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	I'll be right back.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	We're coming with you.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	I was afraid you were going to say that.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	As you wish.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	A word of warning, though...
Glade_Event3_Page2	Louis Tanner	This won't be pretty.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	He's got a point.
Glade_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Stay on your toes in there.
Glade_Event3_Page3	Atlas	We're finished here.
Glade_Event4_Page2	Flórián Dragović	I've got nothing to say to you.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Welcome back.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Let's start from the beginning, shall we?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	What's your name?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Why do we have to go over this again?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	I already told you everything!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I ask, you answer!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Julius Gaston...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Very good!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Profession?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Working the docks, mostly.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	What's the purpose of this hideout?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Keeping our heads dry until we're cleared to enter Trachi.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Liar!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Hit me as much as you want.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	At some point, it's all coming back to you.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	You think Heinrich would have tolerated behaviour like that?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	How dare you lecture me on morals!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	But I digress...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Now, I'm going to ask you one last time: Did or did you not try to smuggle contraband into the city?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	As you can see, our things are not being taken anywhere.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	So what's your business hiding out here, then?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Are you deaf?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	I just told you.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	We were waiting for the customs officer to approve our request, then you lot showed up.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Then I hope you don't mind me asking...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Can you proof that?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	Huh?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	You heard me.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	How about you go ask your people at the custom's office, instead?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	We did.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	So?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	None of the staff were able to confirm your statement.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	And neither was there any record of your application.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	What!?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Your confusion is as big as mine.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Come on, Julius.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Out with the truth!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	This can't be right!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	I was there, and you know it!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I wish.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	But as it stands...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	This is your last chance to confess!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Admit it already, you scum!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Julius Gaston	No!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	You know, I always respected you.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	It's a pity, really.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	By power of Parliament...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I hereby judge you guilty of attempting a large-scale smuggling operation.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Corporal, the cleaver!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Aleks Smola	Aye Sir!
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Seriously?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Something you want to say?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Is that how you handle problems around here?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Am I to take this as an official act of intervention?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	No.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Carry on.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	You're ok with this?
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	My personal opinion doesn't matter.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	We should go.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	My thoughts, exactly.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I'll be back at the checkpoint as soon as I can.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I certainly hope so.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	If not...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Yes, yes...
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I know.
Refuge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	We'll see you there.
Refuge_Event2_Page1	Aleks Smola	...
Refuge_Event2_Page2	Aleks Smola	What a piece of shit...
Refuge_Event3_Page1	Metod Csorba	Get a move on.
Refuge_Event6_Page1	Lucian Jankovics	Stay away from the suspects.
Refuge_Event7_Page1	Louis Tanner	After me, if you'd be so kind.
Refuge_Event8_Page1	Lucian Jankovics	Stay away from the suspects!
Refuge_Event9_Page1	Louis Tanner	Alright.
Refuge_Event9_Page1	Louis Tanner	Wake him up.
Refuge_Event11_Page1	Atlas	We should see this.
Refuge_Event12_Page1	Atlas	We should see this.
Refuge_Event13_Page2	Louis Tanner	You should leave.
Refuge_Event14_Page1	Klim Vlašič	Don't touch anything.
Nestville_Event1_Page1	Şebnem Vukoja	Woah! Outsiders!
Nestville_Event1_Page1	Şebnem Vukoja	Y-you're not one of those mercenaries, are you?
Nestville_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You're damn right we are!
Nestville_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Here to claim what's ours at last!
Nestville_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Will you stop, for pity's sake?
Nestville_Event1_Page2	Şebnem Vukoja	Please don't hurt me!
Nestville_Event2_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Hot damn, that's going to be a great harvest at that rate!
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	Hey, you!
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	Can I interest you in some jewelry, perhaps?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	Everything made here in Nestville, of course!
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Daphne	A bit crude for my taste...
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Daphne	How much you willing to let it go for?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	Mmh, let me think...
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	How about three lesser vouchers?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Come again?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	You're foreigners, aren't you?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You could say that.
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	What else you've got, then?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Do you accept Rondhi, by any chance?
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	Sorry to burst your bubble, lady...
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Agáta Vlahović	But money is so last century!
Nestville_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Didn't think we'd ever see the day bartering gets a renaissance!
Nestville_Event3_Page2	Agáta Vlahović	Come back when you've got something real to trade.
Nestville_Event4_Page1	Neno Megalos	I've got my eyes on you.
Nestville_Event8_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event9_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event11_Page1	Profane Man	I'm afraid the storage is off-limits.
Nestville_Event11_Page2	Profane Man	Gotta make a new lock at some point soon...
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	I've been expecting you.
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	I think you might be confusing us with someone else.
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Not at all!
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Three vagabonds from afar, it said.
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Strong-willed heroes, not to be deterred by any force, be it man or nature.
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Atlas	Your point, if you'd be so kind.
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Yes, yes!
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	I can feel it churning within you!
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	A fire smoldering, but unignited.
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Honey?
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Are you harassing strangers again?
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	Silence!
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Simona Bokor	I will not be inhibited!
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	What exactly are we witnessing here?
Nestville_Event12_Page1	Atlas	We better get some distance while she's distracted.
Nestville_Event12_Page2	Simona Bokor	I refuse to desist, you hear me?
Nestville_Event12_Page2	Ilija Bokor	Yes, I get that.
Nestville_Event12_Page2	Ilija Bokor	Will you at the very least join us for dinner now?
Nestville_Event14_Page1	Atlas	There's no point going back in there.
Nestville_Event15_Page1	Ljiljana Antonescu	I could stand here all day!
Nestville_Event17_Page1	Ruf Vacík	What're you looking at?
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Daphne	Speak of the devil.
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Daphne	You okay?
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Ganymede	We miss anything important?
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Atlas	Nothing, really.
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Atlas	Just mistook me for someone else.
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Atlas	Let's see if we can get an appointment with the councillor, now.
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Atlas	Let's keep on looking.
Nestville_Event18_Page2	Daphne	Alright.
Nestville_Event21_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event22_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event23_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event24_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event25_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event26_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event27_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event28_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event29_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event30_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event31_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event32_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event33_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event34_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event35_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event36_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event37_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event38_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event39_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event40_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event41_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Nestville_Event42_Page1	Dimitrios Orosz	Don't step on the crops, please!
Randolph Trail_Event1_Page1	Atlas	No point going back there anymore.
Randolph Trail_Event2_Page1	Atlas	HEY!
Randolph Trail_Event3_Page1	Atlas	HEY!
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Nestville is the other way.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Mind telling me what you're trying to do here?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Considering you're the one throwing random questions at people...
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Daphne	How about you introduce yourself, first?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	It's not me who's trying to enter a peaceful village unannounced!
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Atlas	You're part of this enclave?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	You bet!
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	The name's Tillian.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	I'm the deputy leader of Nestville's militia.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Now, how about you tell me what's your business here?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Atlas	You know a man named Heinrich?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	You talked to him?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Atlas	On our way here, yeah.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	How is he?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	Pretty grumpy.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	The usual, then.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Do you have a village chief or someone we can talk to?
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Yeah.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Not sure if anyone's available...
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	But knowing Kris, he's probably still in the council hall.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	It's the big building at the end of the road.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Alright.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Thanks for your help.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Don't mention it.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	I finished my patrol for today.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	So I'll be here until nightfall, if you need anything else.
Randolph Trail_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Later then!
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	Hey.
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Tillian Márton	Back already?
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Tillian Márton	How did it go?
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Positively.
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Tillian Márton	Glad to hear it!
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Atlas	You'll be leading us into the city?
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Tillian Márton	Yup.
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Tillian Márton	The boat is just a bit west of here.
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Alright.
Randolph Trail_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Let's go, then.
Randolph Trail_Event7_Page1	Atlas	North: Nestville South: Trachi Autonomous community Nestville
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	Hey there!
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	What can I do for you?
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Is the councillor in, by any chance?
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	Ah, it's you!
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	He's in a meeting right now.
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	And wants me to relay his sincere apologies for the delay.
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Excuse me?
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Atlas	He knows we're here?
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	Naturally!
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	I could almost hear Tilian screaming at you from here.
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	You see, when our little enclave isn't arguing about something, we're able to function almost like a proper community would.
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Costin Hornick	I mean, we've only been at it for three years –
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I get your point.
Council Reception_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Let's wait... somewhere else.
Council Reception_Event2_Page2	Costin Hornick	Welcome back!
Council Reception_Event2_Page2	Costin Hornick	I'm very sorry, but the meeting is still in session.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	Oh, it's you again!
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	How's your stay in Nestville so far?
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Atlas	Prolonged, to say at least.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	Hey there!
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	What can I do for you?
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Atlas	Is your councillor in?
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	Ah, it's you!
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	He's already waiting for you in the council hall.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Atlas	He knows we're here?
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	Naturally!
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	I could almost hear Tilian screaming at you from here.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	You see, when our little enclave isn't arguing about something, we're almost able to function like a proper community would.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	I mean, we've only been at it for three years –
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Atlas	I get your point.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Costin Hornick	Well, I'll inform the councillor right away.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Kristofor De Bloom	That won't be necessary.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Kristofor De Bloom	Pleased to meet you.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Kristofor De Bloom	My name is Kristofor De Bloom.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Kristofor De Bloom	I'm the head-councillor of Nestville.
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Kristofor De Bloom	Now, I'd like to talk with you about a few things...
Council Reception_Event2_Page3	Kristofor De Bloom	If you'd follow me, please.
Council Reception_Event2_Page4	Costin Hornick	I wouldn't let him wait.
Council Reception_Event2_Page5	Costin Hornick	Hope you have a nice day.
Council Reception_Event6_Page3	Costin Hornick	**Locked**
Council Reception_Event6_Page3	Atlas	We're finished here.
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Changed your mind?
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Well?
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Atlas	It would be rude to refuse, right?
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Precisely!
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Just give me a second, I'll set the table.
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I'd be happy to help!
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Thank you!
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	It's highly appreciated!
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Atlas	I'm afraid it's still a no.
De Bloom House_Event3_Page2	Marina De Bloom	A shame.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Just a tiny bit more salt...
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	There... Now it's perfect!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Ganymede	Certainly smells great from where I'm standing!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Oh, excuse me!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	I didn't hear you come in.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Can I help you, by any chance?
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Sorry for intruding.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	We were having a look around...
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	And apparently, some of us can't resist the scent of a freshly cooked meal.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Daphne	I firmly recall you being the first one to cross the doorframe.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Ganymede	I second that notion!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Honestly...
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Here's a thought!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Why don't the three of you sit down and have dinner with me?
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	We couldn't possibly accept that.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	But you came here looking for something, didn't you?
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	And you think we've just stumbled into the right place?
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	You never know!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Well?
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Great!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Just give me a second, I'll set the table right away!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Ganymede	I'd be happy to help, if you don't mind.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Thank you, it's highly appreciated!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	I'm sorry.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Your offer is very kind.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	But we have to be somewhere.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	I see!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Don't worry about it!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	You're always welcome!
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Atlas	It's appreciated.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	Don't mention it.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	You know where to find me.
De Bloom House_Event4_Page1	Marina De Bloom	I hope we'll meet again, someday.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	You sure you don't want any help with the dishes?
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	One hundred percent!
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	You've already done more than enough.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Let me at least clean the table, then.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Absolutely not!
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	I rarely get the chance to spend time with you, these days.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	And I won't squander it by having you do chores!
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I'm sorry...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Council work has been piling up on me, lately.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	No need to apologize.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	I can't claim you entirely for myself, after all.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Still...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I haven't been a good husband in any sense of the word.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Oh, don't you worry about that.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	You are a man with many talents...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	And you have your heart in the right place.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	No wife could ask for more!
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	If you say so.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Kris...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	What's on your mind?
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I need to ask you something.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Those people from Ionia...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	How did you know they'd come here?
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Was only a matter of time, really.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Hm.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	I'm sorry.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	It's alright.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I wish you'd tell me more...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	But I know that you have a good reason not to.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	It's safer that way, yeah.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	So...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	When are you leaving?
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Do you want me to?
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I'm serious, Eury.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I know you want to go.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	You were just waiting for them to show up.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Once I leave...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	I'll never be able to come back again.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I am aware of that.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	And I'd do anything to make you stay.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	But neither of us can hide out here, forever.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	You're right, as always.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	I'm just worried, that-
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	It's going to happen, anyway.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Julius bought us a bit of time, nothing more.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Still...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	There's got to be something I can do!
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	There is, actually.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	But not in Nestville.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Eurydice	Huh?
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	We've been through a lot, you and I.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I thought I was finished, two years ago.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	But you picked me back up.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	Today, I'll return the favour.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I'll give you something, Eury.
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	I'll tell you...
De Bloom House_Event19_Page2	Kristofor De Bloom	About arteria.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Ganymede	That was amazing!
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Daphne	Agreed!
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Thank you!
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	I just hope we left enough for your other guests.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Well...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	I'm sorry.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Hm?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	It's been a while since I've had company for dinner.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	So I might have been a bit pushy earlier.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	The truth is...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	I'm very glad to have someone sit down with me once in a while.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	And when I heard the three of you talking...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	I couldn't help but feel like I was back home, again.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	It's me who should apologize.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	I had no right to be nosy.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	I'm sorry I brought it up.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	It's fine.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Say...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	I have a question for you, specifically.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	If you don't mind, of course.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	What kind of question?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Daphne	Gany?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Ganymede	Hm?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Daphne	There's something I want to check out real quick...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Daphne	Mind accompanying me?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Ganymede	Sure, I guess..
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Ganymede	Well, I'll see you later, then.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Ganymede	Thank you very much for the meal!
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	You're welcome.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Feel free to stop by anytime you're in town.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Travelling with those two must be a lot of fun.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	I'm afraid you've just witnessed the one occasion where they behaved somewhat discretely.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Though their enthusiasm is commendable, without a doubt.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	That's not what you wanted to ask me, though...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Right?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Right!
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Now, I hope I'm not imagining things...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	We've met before, haven't we?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Possibly.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Mhm.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	So...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	What are you doing here?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	I'm sorry.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	But I can't tell you.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	So it's like that, hm?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	You're still not satisfied?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	What do you mean by that?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	You've destroyed everything I ever loved.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	And now, after all these years...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	You turn up and pretend that nothing happened.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	So what's it gonna be, Atlas?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Are you going to drag me back to Ionia?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Or will you take care of it right here?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	You've got it all wrong.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	I'm not here because of you.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	In fact, we're supposed to be somewhere else, entirely.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Well, what a coincidence.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	But since you're at least trying to be honest, I'll return the favour.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	I couldn't care less about what kind of chaos you are trying to wreak, this time.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Go ahead...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	And do your worst.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	But if any harm comes to this village...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	I will hold the three of you accountable.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Is that all?
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	Yeah.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Marina De Bloom	We're finished.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Alright.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Thank you for having us.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	It was extraordinary, as always.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Atlas	Farewell, Eury.
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Eurydice	You too...
De Bloom House_Event26_Page2	Eurydice	Atlas.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Matej Chalupa	It says here that the custom's office denied your request.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Matej Chalupa	How did "Atlas" react to this state of affairs?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	You don't need to emphasize his designation like that...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Matej Chalupa	Answer the question please.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Our original schedule had us inside Trachi, at that point.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	So I'm guessing he was pretty pissed.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	At least he wanted to appear that way.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Matej Chalupa	What do you mean by that?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	It was bullshit, obviously.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Matej Chalupa	Elaborate.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Matej Chalupa	Answer.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	As you know...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Most people working the field aren't particularly proud of what they're doing.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	But Atlas...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	He played the self-loathing type way too well.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	So I had a feeling that he not only hated himself for the things he did.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	But for the way he came to enjoy them.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Matej Chalupa	That was the first time you met Lieutenant Tanner?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Yes.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Matej Chalupa	Were you aware of his affiliation at that time?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	He struck me as the kind of person who's only looking out for themselves.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	So yeah...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I knew he couldn't be trusted.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Matej Chalupa	What about Daphne?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Shouldn't you be asking her that question, instead?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Matej Chalupa	Answer.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Let me put it this way...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Everyone who deals with Tanner thinks exactly the same thing.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	He might be a backstabbing son of a bitch.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	"But I can use him." That's what Faber thought.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	And so did I.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I imagine Daphne felt something similar, as well.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Mind turning that thing down a bit?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	I'm starting to lose focus.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Matej Chalupa	Answer.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	We entered Nestville...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	As I said.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	It felt...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Peculiar.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Wooden houses, most of them.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Frontier village.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Matej Chalupa	Population?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Seriously...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	What are you trying to prove here?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Are you insane?!
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	They were eager...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Willing.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Prospective.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	!!!
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	But all of them...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Left something behind.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Waiting.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Lurking.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Looming.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Threatening to catch up.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I was wondering when you'd turn up.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	It's been a while, hm?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Two years, right?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	To the day.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	So?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	You came here to gloat, or what?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	I wish I had the time to.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Poor you.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Wanna trade spots?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	I would love to.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	But I wouldn't be able to play it half as good as you.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Maybe.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	But I guess we'll find out, one day.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	Perhaps, yeah.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	Until then, though...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	We've got some more urgent business to take care of.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Oh, so that's what it's about?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	They had to call you in, just for me?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	You've been telling a lot of interesting stories, from what I heard.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Just the odd tale, here and there.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Though I'd imagine Atlas and Gregor told you everything, already.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	I'm sure.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	But I also bet there's a lot more than just that.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Maybe.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Wanna find out?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	With pleasure.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Glad to hear that.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	To be honest...
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I've grown a bit bored, lately.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I've grown a bit bored, anyway.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Daphne	They really know how to pick them, don't they?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Me putting a bullet through your head, for starters.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Dimitar Atanasov	Your name is Timotej Stojanov.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Dimitar Atanasov	Two days ago, you helped facilitate an armed insurrection in the city state of Trachi.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Dimitar Atanasov	Going against your given orders, you caused irreparable damage to both the Ionian intelligence network and the nation as a whole.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Dimitar Atanasov	You are therefore charged with treason.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Dimitar Atanasov	Do you plead guilty?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Ganymede	Hm?
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Ganymede	Oh, sorry.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Ganymede	I didn't quite catch that.
IIS Interrogation_Event1_Page5	Ganymede	Would you mind saying that again?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	I'll get straight to the point.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Heinrich sent you, from what I heard.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	And while I'm glad he had someone to speak with...
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	It also means that the matter is serious.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	You've heard what's happening at the checkpoint?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Bits and pieces of it.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Though we're trying our best not to get involved.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	And yet, you're here.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Right.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Well then...
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	What can I do for you?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	We need to enter Trachi.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Today.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	What makes you think I can help you with that?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Does the name Julius Gaston ring any bells?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	What about him?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Don't play dumb with me.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	I know he's one of your people.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Is he alright?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Last time we saw him, he was about to get maimed.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Damn it...
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	He's likely still being questioned.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	But we can get him out, if you want.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	You're asking for a trade?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	As you said it.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Alright.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Under one condition.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Go ahead.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	There's someone I want you to take with you.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Call it insurance.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	You think that's necessary?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Essential.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Who is it?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	You've met him, already.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	It's Tillian.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	I see.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	We'll do as proposed.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Glad we could come to an agreement.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	There's a small waterway, just west of this village.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Tillian will show you the way.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Present this to the person watching the boat.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	What about security in Trachi?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	There's a maintenance access at the northern partition of the wall.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	It leads straight into the eastern sewer network.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	The entrance itself is guarded by a set of two Guardsmen.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	When does the night shift usually take over?
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	These are the records of the last two weeks.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Though there's a high chance they've changed it, after what happened today.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	But seeing as that likelihood will only increase...
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	You might as well give it a shot.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Thank you.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to work.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Best of luck to you.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	And to you.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	One more thing.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	I hope I'm not adding more fuel to the fire by helping you.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	We'll see about that.
Council Hall_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Until next time.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	What do you want?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	Hey Damien!
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	You're still on watch?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Oh, it's you!
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	You weren't supposed to be here for at least another hour.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Who's that with you?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	It's a long story.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	And we need to get going soon.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Listen...
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	I was nice enough to let you take the boat once, seeing how desperate you were.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	But I won't put my ass on the line just so you can see your girlfriend again.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	She's not my girlfriend!
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Are you two finished?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Who are you again?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	It doesn't matter.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	As you can see, your councillor granted us passage.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Hm.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Looks legit to me.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Wish I could say the same about you.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Whatever the case might be...
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	We really need to get going now.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Don't let me keep you, then.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Thank you.
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	Oh... and Tillian?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	Yeah?
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	You still owe me, don't you forget that!
Waterway_Event1_Page2	Tillian Márton	...
Waterway_Event1_Page3	Damien Fyodorov	What are you waiting for?
Waterway_Event2_Page1	Tillian Márton	Over there.
Waterway_Event2_Page1	Tillian Márton	I'll handle this.
Waterway_Event2_Page1	Tillian Márton	Yo!
Waterway_Event3_Page1	Atlas	It's in here?
Waterway_Event3_Page1	Tillian Márton	Yeah.
Waterway_Event3_Page1	Tillian Márton	Let me take the cover off.
Waterway_Event3_Page1	Tillian Márton	Alright.
Waterway_Event3_Page1	Tillian Márton	One... and two!
Waterway_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	Can't believe it's finally happening.
Waterway_Event4_Page2	Atlas	We're not inside the city yet.
Waterway_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Considering our track record...
Waterway_Event4_Page2	Daphne	We're about to get hit by a lightning strike.
Waterway_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Then let's move, before it catches up to us.
Waterway_Event4_Page2	Tillian Márton	Are you guys always that cynical?
Third Floor_Event4_Page2	Icarus	God, I'm tired.
Third Floor_Event4_Page2	Icarus	These guys really are a bunch of work...
Kenović_Event1_Page1	Goran Vinković	Nothing to see here.
Kenović_Event2_Page1	Corneliu Babić	Man, is this rain ever gonna stop?
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Aren't we supposed to go from west to east?
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Did you hear that?
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Yep.
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Would you mind?
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I thought you'd never ask.
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Alright.
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Listen up, whoever's in there!
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Either you be a kind citizen and open this door at once...
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Or we'll have to force our way through!
Kenović_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Well, looks like the lot of you won't have a front door anymore!
Kenović_Event3_Page2	Lorna Faragó	I'll take point.
Kenović_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Just don't forget to check your corners.
Kenović_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Coming!
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Besnik Petrović	Yeah?
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Atlas	EnKAD.
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Besnik Petrović	I'm terribly sorry!
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Besnik Petrović	This has to be a mistake!
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Calm down.
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Atlas	It's just a routine inspection.
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Mind if we come in?
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Besnik Petrović	Oh!
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Besnik Petrović	No!
Kenović_Event4_Page2	Besnik Petrović	Not at all...
Kenović_Event4_Page4	Atlas	We have to keep going.
Kenović_Event5_Page1	Atlas	This one's been cleared, already.
Kenović_Event6_Page1	Atlas	That one has been cleared, already.
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Uhm...
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Not that it's my business or anything...
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But aren't we supposed to search their homes, too?
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Atlas	You're right.
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Atlas	Looks like I've forgotten that one.
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Is that so?
Kenović_Event7_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Unfortunate.
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Lorna Faragó	HEY!
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Not dozing off in the middle of a mission, are we?
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Seriously...
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Like there's a point in rushing things...
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Atlas	This place is cordoned off, anyway.
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Whatever you say~ But can we at least take shelter somewhere?
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Lorna Faragó	It's pouring like crazy, if you haven't noticed!
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Let's keep checking those houses.
Kenović_Event8_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Righto!
Kenović_Event9_Page1	Veljko Radkov	Move along.
Kenović_Event10_Page1	Veljko Radkov	WARNING: Curfew in place.
Kenović_Event10_Page1	Veljko Radkov	Please stay inside.
Kenović_Event11_Page1	Mitko Daskalov	This road is temporarily closed.
Kenović_Event12_Page1	Atanas Kozel	High road and Ribon Alley succesfully secured, sir!
Preston House_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Another one, really?
Preston House_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Well, time's a wasting!
Preston House_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Don't get your hopes up.
Preston House_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Whoops!
Preston House_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Stop right there!
Preston House_Event1_Page3	Atlas	There's nothing left for us to do here.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Wait.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Atlas	What's wrong?
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I know I shouldn't be asking this.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Then don't.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	You knew that guy, didn't you?
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Atlas	You listened?
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Overheard, more like.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	He screamed his lungs out, if you hadn't noticed.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Yeah...
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Some people do that.
Preston House_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	What about you?
First level_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	The window!
First level_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I'll go after him.
First level_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I don't think splitting up is a good idea.
First level_Event1_Page1	Atlas	But we don't really have a choice.
First level_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Right.
First level_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I'll be back in a second.
First level_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Might as well use the chance.
First level_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I should hurry up, there's no telling when she'll be back.
First level_Event4_Page2	Atlas	You're back already.
First level_Event4_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Yup.
First level_Event4_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Couldn't find a damn thing back there.
First level_Event4_Page2	Lorna Faragó	A few scraps of cloth, and a bit of blood.
First level_Event4_Page2	Lorna Faragó	But nothing else.
First level_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Doesn't matter.
First level_Event4_Page2	Atlas	We got what we came for.
First level_Event4_Page2	Lorna Faragó	That's good news, I guess.
First level_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Yup.
First level_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Let's head back and report.
First level_Event4_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Yeah.
Second Level_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I should hurry up, there's no telling when she'll be back.
Second Level_Event2_Page3	Atlas	I'll see you in hell.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Of all the people.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Are you alone?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	For now.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Convenient.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	You know why I'm here?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Yeah.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	And you know that I won't cooperate.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	A shame.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Are you sure?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	You think I'm enjoying this?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Atlas...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Do you remember the day I recruited you?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	I knew you'd be good at this.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	But I was sure that someone like you...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Someone who has suffered through so much, himself.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Would understand that people like us can't help but create misery.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	It's true...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Most of us hate ourselves for the things we do.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	But you...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Are made up of something else, entirely.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	I don't know what drives you, exactly.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	But during those ten years I worked for EnKAD...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	I've never seen anyone enjoy it half as much as you do.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	I'm going to state this for the sake of completeness...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Your name is Daniil Preston.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Former deputy to the chairman of the Ionian Revolutionary Comittee.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Now acting ringleader of the self-
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	proclaimed Free People's Syndicate.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Four days ago, your men seized a shipment from Kenović central station.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Where did you take it?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	I don't want to repeat myself.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Would be a waste of breath, anyways.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Right.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	You of all people should be aware -
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	I wouldn't stall if I were you.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Time isn't on your side.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Cecilia...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	You fucking monster!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Thirty minutes until we start on the thumbs.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Do you really want to know what's going to happen after that?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	I'm going to need an answer, soon.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	You're not going to get one.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Alright...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	What-
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	No...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	NO!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Not her as well!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	She's a child, damn you!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Daniil...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	As I said-
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	It was you, wasn't it?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Don't start this.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	You're right.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	It doesn't matter, anymore.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Silk Street 32.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Thank you.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Save it.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	You'll take care of them?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	We always do.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Good.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Go ahead, then.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Don't let a dead man keep you.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Daniil Preston	Do it, you coward!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Rest easy...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Comrade.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	So... how can I help you?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Just a few questions.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	O-of course!
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Your name, please.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Besnik Petrović.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Occupation?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	I'm a factotum, doing all kinds of work.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Including?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Helping out on construction sites, for the most part.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	And apart from that?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Used to work as a seasonal farmhand.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	That girl over there...
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	She's your daughter?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Yes.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Where's her mother?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Died during child-birth.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I see.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	How long have you been living in this house?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Three years, or four maybe.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	You know your neighbours well?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Not really...
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	As you might have noticed, we are kind of sticking out.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Well, I think we're about done here.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Nothing I can think of right now.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Please let us know if there's something else you'd like to add to your statement.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Thank you for your cooperation.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Atlas	And have a nice day.
Shack_Event2_Page1	Besnik Petrović	Likewise.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Come in.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	You're late.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	I know.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I read your report.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	A shame it's come to this.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	But Hyperion wanted you there.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	I figured as much.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	For what it's worth, he's very pleased with the outcome.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	And I think you're in for a promotion.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I'm sorry Atlas.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	No need for that.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	Daniil knew what he signed up for.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Right.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	And let's not forget...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	That you've saved a countless number of lives.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	The grain is being prepared for shipment to Hermin, as we speak.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Atlas...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	If you're concerned about Dorothy-
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	She'll manage.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Did you talk to her?
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	A few hours ago.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Did you tell her?
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	I had to.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	How did she take it?
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	As well as you might expect.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	She's a tough girl.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	But I doubt she'll ever forgive me.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I see.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I don't think I ever told you, by the way...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Hyperion wants to recruit her.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	What?!
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	No fucking way!
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	I won't let it happen.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	You know how he is...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Once he's got his eye on someone-
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	Fuck him, then!
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	ATLAS!
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Do you remember...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	How I tried to keep Lorna out?
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	That didn't go very well, did it?
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	And while we're on that topic...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	You need to talk to her.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	Soon.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I don't think this is the time nor the place.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	I'm serious, Eury.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Atlas	And so is she.
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Alright...
Debriefing Eury_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Tell me.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Can I be blunt?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Always.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I'm not good a fit.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	That's what you said to me before Hermingrad, too.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	This is different.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I have barely any experience abroad.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	It's a great opportunity to remedy that.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Besides, you won't be working alone.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Your associates will be more than able to compensate.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	And who are they, exactly?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	You know one of them, already.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	It's Atlas.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	You've got to be kidding me.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	He's been to Trachi, before.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	And he knows her better than anyone else.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Which is why I need someone to keep an eye on him, while he's there.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	But why me?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Because the two of you have a history.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I don't see how that's relevant.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	There's something you need to understand about Atlas...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	He can't help but feel responsible for all the misery in the world.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Including what happened to you.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	My point is...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Atlas won't be able to see you straight.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I know I'm asking for a lot.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	So I'll leave it up to you.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	If I do it...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	You'll have to tell me everything you know about him.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Including what happened between him and my dad.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	What about the other one?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	Fero's candidate?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	It's going to be Icarus, right?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	Apparently not.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Hm?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	I don't understand.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	Curious, isn't it?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	Here is Fero, with one of our best men at his disposal...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	An operative who's not only been born and raised in Trachi...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	But also desperately wants to bring it back.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	And yet, he has his mind set on someone else.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Who?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	One of his protégés from the external branch.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	A former CoExA member, unsurprisingly.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	Have you ever heard of an agent called Ganymede?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Only hearsay.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page2	Teron Pravoskos	Exactly.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Okay.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I'll do it.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Teron Pravoskos	Are you sure?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Teron Pravoskos	No harm in thinking it over a night or two.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Doesn't matter.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I'm set.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Teron Pravoskos	Alright.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	There's one thing I need to know, though.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	If push comes to shove...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Teron Pravoskos	The primary target will do.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Understood.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	I'm not a diplomat, mind you.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	I know.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	You're not going there to hammer out terms...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	But to enforce them.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	That's it?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	Yeah.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Alright.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	I refuse.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	What?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	You said it'd be up to me.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	It is.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	But I'd like to hear a reason, at least.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	It's simple, really.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	You're trying to bullshit me.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	Excuse me?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Both of us know you could send anybody.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	So I'm guessing...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	There's something else.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	Hm.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	In any case.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	If that's all...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	I'll go and catch up on some sleep.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	Atlas.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	You ever wondered what happened to Eurydice?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	If you're trying to guilt-trip me into this-
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	She's been seen in Trachi.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	I'm not falling for that again.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	And you shouldn't, either.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	De Bloom confirmed it.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	And you want me to make sure it's her?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	Precisely.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	And afterwards?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	Watch her and wait.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	For what?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	For Orpheus to show himself.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Atlas	You think he's still around?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	His fingerprints are all over the area.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	He's planning something.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page4	Teron Pravoskos	And I want you to put a stop to it.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	It's your choice.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	But there has to be a better way, surely.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Eurydice	I don't think anything else will suffice.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Eurydice	We all have to let go, at some point.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	Right.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	No need to burn bridges, though.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Eurydice	You're better not implying-
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	Of course not!
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	I don't want you to spy on them.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	On the contrary...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	I want you to try and mend the rift.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	That's all I'm asking for as a parting gift.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	In any case...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	I'll discuss the transfer with Fero, first thing tomorrow.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Eurydice	Alright.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Eurydice	Thank you, for everything.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	I'm the one who should be thanking you.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	You've been one of the greatest assets EnKAD ever had.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page5	Hyperion	And I'm very sorry to see you go.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	I see.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	That does sound troublesome.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	Does Atlas know about this?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Daphne	No idea.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	Hm.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Daphne	Want me to find out?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	I couldn't possibly put that on you.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Daphne	You don't need to worry about me.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Daphne	I can handle him.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	I'm sure you can.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	But I'd rather not overcomplicate things.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	I'll have a word with him, tomorrow.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Daphne	Alright.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page6	Hyperion	I'm sure we can find a way to fix all this.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	With all due respect...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	Are you insane?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	We need to do something, Atlas.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	And you know it.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	That's not what I'm talking about.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	What is it, then?
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	Stop playing games with me.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	You know Lorna's on that list.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	And you know I have little control over military affairs.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	Convenient.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Listen, Atlas...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	I've been very patient with you, so far.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	In fact...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	The only reason why you're on MY list, is because I'm doing you a favour.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	So if you don't want to participate...
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Be my guest.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Atlas	You know I wouldn't let her go with anyone else.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Right.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Now, if you'd let me finish this time.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	I can explain it to you, properly.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	The people going to that dam are as good as dead, as we both know.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Which is why I won't send you there.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	I've made a couple of inquiries.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	About the strength of our forces at the border to Amryn.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Naturally, most of our troops are deployed in the area around Trachi, at the moment.
Prawnfield Briefing_Event2_Page7	Hyperion	Leaving the eastern checkpoints stretched incredibly thin.
Loge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	The embassy is in Gharten Street, northwest of Trenton Plaza.
Loge_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Don't you have somewhere else to be?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Right.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	You have the keys?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	Mhm.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Will he manage?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Daphne	Yup.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Daphne	As long as his wife is safe, he'll do any-
Loge_Event1_Page8	Daphne	thing.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Good.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	So...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	What's next?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	We wait.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	But in the meantime...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	We should focus on dealing with two issues.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	First, the Tanner situation.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	We know far too litle of him.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Daphne	What do you know him, then?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Not much.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	He's a founding member of the Republican Guard.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Used to be a mobster.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	But Faber managed to mobilize him for his cause.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	And so he brought him into the Guard?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Yup.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	He's his patron, so to speak.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Of course, not everyone is happy about that.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	There's also the "old Guard".
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	People from Amryn's former garrison.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	I see...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	Neither of them sound particularly sympathetic to me.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Right.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	In any case...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	We have a contact inside the eastern prefecture.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	And enough men at his disposal to safeguard our bridgehead.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Just in case something goes wrong, of course.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Regardless, he agreed to a meeting.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	Okay.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	So?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	In his office.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Ganymede	And you want one of us, to go?
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	In his office.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	And then there's also Amryn to deal with.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	For this reason, we've activated one of our assetts in the administration.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	The administrator of Filmore, to be precise.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	He's agreed to facilitate a meeting with Faber, this evening.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	At his house in Filmore Avenue.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	I'll need the two of you to prepare his house for our hit.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Daphne.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Daphne	Right here!
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	You'll take care of the upper level, including our man, himself.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Daphne	Got it!
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	Ganymede, on the other hand...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	At the same time, Ganymede will stake out the ground floor...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	And make sure that his wife won't get in the way.
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	She doesn't know about any of this, according to him...
Loge_Event1_Page8	Atlas	So try to be on your best behaviour.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You're back.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	And you're on your feet again.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Still a bit shaky.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But getting better by the minute.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Glad to hear that.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Listen...
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm sorry for what happened, last night.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	It's alright.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	We weren't supposed to be in those sewers, anyway.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Still..
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Thanks for saving me.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Don't worry about it.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So...
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	How did your meeting with Faber go?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	As expected.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	He's a bunch of work, to put it mildly.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Did he say anything about what happened at the checkpoint?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	He claimed that Amryn somehow got wind of our plans.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	And that he was forced to put up a show.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You think he's telling the truth?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Who knows...
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	But I intend to find out.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	You know where Amryn's embassy is?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Uhmm...
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	It's west of here, isn't it?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	In Gharten Street, I think?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Precisely.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Just head across Trenton Plaza and keep to the northwest.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	The embassy is the first house to your right.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Got it!
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Don't know if you've seen it...
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	But they're conducting identity checks on some of the bridges.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah, there's Guardsmen all over the place.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You've been to Trachi before, right?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Some time ago, yeah.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	But it felt very different, back then.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I see.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	In any case.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Faber gave me the papers he promised.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You want me to use them?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You sure about that?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Feels like he's just gonna try to track us with that.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Exactly.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I see.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So what do you want me to do?
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Nothing extraordinary.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Just keep an eye on the embassy.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	See who enters and who leaves.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	If what Faber says is true...
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	They're likely to use something, or someone, to communicate with the leak.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Makes sense.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'll be back later, then.
Loge_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Good luck out there.
Loge_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	Just keep her busy, then?
Loge_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Exactly.
Loge_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Let Daphne handle the rest.
Loge_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	Okay.
Loge_Event3_Page4	Daphne	I'll go and get into position, then.
Loge_Event3_Page4	Daphne	See you there.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Hm...
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	He's not here, either.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	I have a bad feeling about this.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	...
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	What is it?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	They have Ralph.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Who?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Hector.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	What does he want?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	A meeting.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Seriously?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Yeah.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Where?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Their embassy.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	In twenty minutes.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	This has to be a trap.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Agreed.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	So what do we do?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	I don't think we have a lot of options.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	This might be our last shot to get him.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Wandering like that into the lion's den, though?
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Let me call for backup, at the very least.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	We don't have time for that.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	If you don't want to come, I can understand that.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Daphne	You know I'm not allowed to leave you out of my sight.
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Well, in that case...
Loge_Event3_Page6	Atlas	We should get underway.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	Okay.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Beats me.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Seems that way.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Well, he certainly lives up to his reputation.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	But at least he's handed over our papers.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Daphne	That's good to hear!
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	You're feeling better, Ganymede?
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	Yeah, I'm good to go.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	Thanks for saving me back there.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Don't worry about it.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	How did your survey go?
Loge_Event3_Page8	Daphne	Not much to see outside of the ordinary.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Daphne	But you can definitely feel the tension in the air.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Daphne	Also overheard people talking about something in the like of a lockdown, apparently.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	I heard the same.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	But I guess we'll have to see what happens.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Apparently, Amryn has also heavily increased their presence within the city.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	Do they know we're here?
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	It's hard to tell.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	But I intend to find out.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Have you been to Gharten Street, yet?
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	Nope.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	It's west of here, isn't it?
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Yeah.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Just cross one of the bridges, and orient yourself northwest of Trenton Plaza.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	Once you're there, you should see a big, old-style building to your right.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	That's the Amrynian embassy.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	I want you to keep a watch over that place.
Loge_Event3_Page8	Atlas	And make note of anyone entering or leaving it.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Where the hell is he?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	What the fuck are you doing here?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	You still use this place...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	How did you get in?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	It's been a while.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	But me and Ralph, we go way back, you know.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Anyways...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	I need you to answer a few questions for me.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Like hell!
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Aww...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	No need to get all uppity!
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	I'm not here to hurt you.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	All I need is for you to tell me a little something.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	And in return...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	I'll let you know what happened to your friend.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Yes.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	The blonde one.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	He's adorable, isn't he?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Eury...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	I thought you were smarter than this.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	That's right...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	I know who you are.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	I read all about your little trip to this city...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Two years ago.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	You fucked that one up, didn't you?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Seduced by a double agent...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Pathetic.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	And to top it off...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	You didn't even have the spine to stand up for it.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Instead, you crawled from one shack to the other.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Until you finally found someone desperate enough to take you in.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	So what's the deal?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Did you suck your host dry already?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Bright one, aren't we?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	So proud of your homework!
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	But I've got some bad news for you, little one.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	You already lost.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	When was the last time you saw Atlas, I wonder?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	And with that boy being interrogated right now...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	It's just you...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	And me.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	I'm starting to see why he respects you so much.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	So tell me...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	What was it like?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Seeing the man you fell in love with...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Fuck your little sister, instead?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	What was her name again?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Lorna?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	I would've expected you to hold on to that.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	But seeing as you're playing that card, already...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	You've got to be really, really desperate.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	When did it happen for you, exactly?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Was it love at first sight?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Or did you fall for him after he butchered your daddy?
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Poor Daniil.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	And poor little Dorothy.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	So alone.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	So vulnerable.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Until one day a man came by and offered her a new life.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Hyperion, or Teron...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Or whatever you want to call him.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	The man behind it all.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	And you...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	His loyal, little puppy!
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Longing for your big reward.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	To finally, after eight agonizing years...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Put a bullet through Áron's head.
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	That's...
Loge_Event4_Page2	Eurydice	Why you're really here.
Loge_Event4_Page4	Atlas	I have some business to take care of.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I see...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Getting to her won't be easy.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	What about our man in the parliament?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	He's at odds with Faber, from what I know.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Can't they arrange a meeting?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Maybe.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I'd rather not activate him, so soon.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Let's give him until tomorrow.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Alright.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	What's on your mind, Daph?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	I don't know.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	But Ganymede...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	What about him?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Not sure how to say this...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	He's an oddity, alright.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	But I wouldn't underestimate him.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	He's way too young.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Doesn't the same go for yourself?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Point taken, I guess.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	So?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	It's just...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	I can't put my finger on it.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	But something about him is seriously off.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Listen...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I don't know what you're trying to do here.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	But I'd focus on my objectives, if I were you.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	And I'm not saying this for my sake.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Hyperion doesn't appreciate detours.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Take it from me.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Can I ask you something?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Aren't you doing that already?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Why are you here?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Because I'm told to.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	That's it?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Simple as that.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Are you sure?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I'm doing what can to the best of my abilities, no?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Hm...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	A bit harsh, but I'll take it.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	That's not what I mean.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	There's gotta be something.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Such as?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	You know what I'm referring to.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I'm sure he's already told you everything you need to know.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Or maybe not.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Because otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	It's because of her, isn't it?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Who?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Eurydice?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	You recognized her.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Of course!
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	So why didn't you turn her in?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	What tells you I didn't?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Just an assumption.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Are you sure you can do this?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	What do you mean?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	She used to be your handler, didn't she?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	That business with her sister...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Long concluded.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	As you know.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	For you, as well?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Your point, please.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	I'm just trying to understand...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Your relationship to someone who has been AWOL for almost two years.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	We parted ways long before that.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Until she disappeared.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	And you were sent to find her.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	So again...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Why didn't you turn her in?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Hm.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Answer, Atlas.
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Remember what you said earlier?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	About her sister and me?
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I have to keep an eye on Eury...
Loge_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Because I owe it to her.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Good work out there.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Yeah.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Hm?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Something wrong?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	All good, don't worry.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	It just...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Feels like we're about to cross a line with what we're doing.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Don't know if it makes you feel any better...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	But it's not easy on me, either.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	I wasn't sure, to be honest.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	You always seem so confident.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Got me a bit envious, to be honest!
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Awww...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	That's how you see me?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Guess I'm that good at hiding it.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Have you ever done anything like this before?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	I'm afraid that's classified.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Thought as much.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	So, what's next?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	I'm gonna relay that the stage for tonight is set.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	As for you...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	One of our contacts in the Guard has asked for a meeting.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Normally, Atlas would handle stuff like that.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	But he's off on some goose-chase after one of Amryn's people.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	So I guess you'll have to do the honours.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Who am I meeting?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	His name is Arnold Francesco Solka.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Wait!
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	COLONEL Solka?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	The man himself.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	He's one of our people?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Sort of.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	We know something he doesn't want us to know.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	So we do each other a little favour, here and there.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Anyways...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	There's a chance our hit tonight won't be enough.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	If that's the case...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	We'll need his troops.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	I see.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	There's more.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Tanner might become a problem, down the line.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	So, hopefully...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Solka can fill in some of the gaps for us.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Where's the meeting taking place?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	The prefecture in Sigmund Plaza.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	His office.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Second floor.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	You're shitting me.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Those are the parameters.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Hm.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	You'll be running under the identity of a corporal named Theodore Harrington.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	The name's in their books, so it should stand scrutiny.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	And of course...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	We also got you a uniform.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	So as long as you're not sniffing around too much...
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	You'll be fine.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	I'll go and get changed, then.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	How does it feel?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	It's a bit stiff in places.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	But it'll do.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Glad to hear it.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	I'm gonna head out, then.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Okay.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Ganymede?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	Ya?
Loge_Event6_Page4	Daphne	Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Loge_Event6_Page4	Ganymede	If you say so.
Loge_Event6_Page5	Daphne	The prefecture is in Sigmund Plaza, just south of Anderson Park.
Loge_Event7_Page2	Atlas	You better go before you lose him.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	I see.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	If Amryn has someone in the administration, it could be problematic.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Ganymede	Yeah.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Ganymede	What about our people?
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	We'll have to make find out who's on our side, first.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	Can you deliver a message for me?
Loge_Event7_Page5	Ganymede	Of course!
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	There's a wine trader in Clarin square.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	Ask him for a Chariot 1896.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	And give him this.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	And while you're there...
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	Would you mind keeping an eye on the custom's office after you're done?
Loge_Event7_Page5	Ganymede	Can do!
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	Good.
Loge_Event7_Page5	Atlas	I'll see you later, then.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	How did it go?
Loge_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	He went to the custom's office, but I lost him in there.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	I see.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	If Amryn has someone in the administration, it could be problematic.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Yeah.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	What about our people?
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	We'll have to make find out who's on our side, first.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	Can you deliver a message for me?
Loge_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Of course!
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	There's a wine trader in Clarin square.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	Ask him for a Chariot 1896.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	And give him this.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	And while you're there...
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	Would you mind keeping an eye on the custom's office after you're done?
Loge_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Can do!
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	Good.
Loge_Event7_Page6	Atlas	I'll see you later, then.
Loge_Event7_Page7	Atlas	You better get going.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	I was wondering when you'd show up again.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	It's been a busy couple of days.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	How's Ganymede?
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Good, all things considered.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	Is he on his way back, already?
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Not sure.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	He was still around when I left.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	But I'd assume he'll leave soon.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	I see.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Did you manage to find her?
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	Yup.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	She's even younger than I expected.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	...
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Is she ready to testify?
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	Yeah.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	Told me the entire story.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Alright.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Should we go and see Tanner, then?
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	I would say so.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	You know where he lives?
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Corner house in Farblein Trail.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Daphne	Second floor.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	Good.
Loge_Event7_Page8	Atlas	Then let's get it over with.
Loge_Event8_Page2	Atlas	Back already?
Loge_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	Yeah!
Loge_Event8_Page2	Atlas	Did you find something?
Loge_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	Yup!
Loge_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	I trailed a guy from the embassy to Hudsman.
Loge_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	He dropped a message just north of it.
Loge_Event8_Page2	Atlas	What did it say?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	A bunch of numbers.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Let me think...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	9799...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	2345...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	7542.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Can you make anything of it?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	I'm not sure.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	It's been a while since we've gotten hold on one of their books.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	But I'll check it out.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Did you see who's on the other side?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Yeah!
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	He went into that house over there.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Oh?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	So I might as well keep watch from up here.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	I see.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Don't let me keep you, then.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Oh, I almost forgot.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	I came across Tillian.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Is that so?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Anything important he had to say?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Not really...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	But it made me remember something.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	That councillor we met in Nestville...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	De Bloom, you mean?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Yeah.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Who is he?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	He used to be the administrator of Rondham, until last year.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	What happened?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Shortly after Trachi declared its independence, there was a heated discussion on how to handle citizenship.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Rondham has always harboured a lot of Ionians, among other foreigners.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	As you know, the provisionary parliament decided to make Trachian citizenship exclusive.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	In other words, a lot of Ionians had to either relinquish their original citizenship...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Or pack their things and leave.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Naturally, Ionia wasn't exactly pleased about that.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	So they tried to kill that motion.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Through De Bloom?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Exactly.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	But it went through, regardless.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Yup.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Mainly because Faber backed it.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Most foreigners in Trachi didn't care much about it.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	But some of them decided to return to their home country.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Others went to the DMZ and founded Nestville.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	And De Bloom?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	He lost a significiant part of his electoral base.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	And was unseated by another candidate during last year's election.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	So he went to Nestville?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Correct.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	I see.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Can I ask you something?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Go ahead.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Our little detour through Nestville...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Was that planned?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	What do you mean by that?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Well...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	To me, it looks like we've just followed a script.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	The chicanery at the checkpoint...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	And it just so happens that there's this village, nearby.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	You can't tell me that the option wasn't on the table.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Hm...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Atlas?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	If that were the case, we could've saved ourselves a lot of time if we just went there, directly.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	But we needed to keep up the facade.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	We're not really here to negotiate.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Are we?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Depends on who you're asking.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	But as far as Faber is concerned...
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	We don't expect him to cooperate.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	So we're gearing up for war?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Not if we can prevent it.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	Which is why we should keep our eyes on what's in front of us.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Right!
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	I totally forgot about that!
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	Thanks, though.
Loge_Event8_Page3	Atlas	For what?
Loge_Event8_Page3	Ganymede	For being honest with me.
Loge_Event8_Page4	Ganymede	Alright.
Loge_Event8_Page4	Ganymede	He's leaving.
Loge_Event8_Page4	Ganymede	Looks like he's headed towards Pike Bridge.
Loge_Event8_Page5	Ganymede	I'm gonna go and keep an eye on him.
Loge_Event8_Page5	Ganymede	Be back in a bit.
Loge_Event8_Page5	Atlas	Good hunting.
Loge_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	Nothing for me in Daphne's room.
Loge_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	Nothing for me in Daphne's room.
Loge_Event15_Page3	Ganymede	Not gonna make that mistake twice.
Loge_Event15_Page3	Ganymede	Not gonna make that mistake twice.
Loge_Event17_Page1	Atlas	It should be in here.
Loge_Event17_Page1	Atlas	Figures.
Loge_Event17_Page1	Atlas	Think, Atlas.
Loge_Event20_Page1	Ganymede	Looks like they're not back, yet.
Loge_Event20_Page1	Ganymede	Might as well change and get going.
Loge_Event21_Page1	Daphne	Ready to go?
Loge_Event21_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Loge_Event21_Page1	Daphne	Glad to hear it.
Loge_Event21_Page4	Atlas	You okay?
Loge_Event21_Page4	Daphne	I'm good.
Loge_Event21_Page4	Daphne	Just...
Loge_Event21_Page4	Daphne	Memories.
Loge_Event21_Page4	Atlas	I know what you mean.
Loge_Event24_Page3	Atlas	Hm?
Loge_Event24_Page3	Atlas	Eury...
Loge_Event24_Page3	Atlas	You bloody idiot.
Loge_Event24_Page4	Atlas	Safehouse.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	There you are!
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Sorry it took me a bit.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	Don't worry!
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	How did it go?
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Hard to say.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Solka is pretty reluctant.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	But considering how much dirt we have on him...
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	He'll have to come around.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	Great.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	How's it looking on your end?
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I spoke to De Bloom.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	He'll table the motion in Parliament, today.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Good.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I'm a bit worried about Hendrick, though.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Why?
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	The girl that's with him...
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Ari?
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	Yeah.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	You don't need to be concerned about her.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	She's very persuasive.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	And reliable.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	If you say so.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	What's on your mind?
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I'm not sure if I should be telling you this.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	But I found something.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Yeah?
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I was looking for a file, earlier.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	You know, the one about Trachi's secession.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Right, sorry.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Orpheus	Think I took that one with me, yesterday.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	It's no problem.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I know how much you like to burrow your head in those before you go to bed.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	Anyways...
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I found the file.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	And this.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	I don't want to jump to conclusions.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	So I'd like you to explain yourself.
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	And for your sake...
Loge_Event27_Page1	Eurydice	You better make it good.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	Describe them to me.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	Both of them had brown hair.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	The man was slightly shorter than the woman.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	He had crimson eyes, hers were deep emerald.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	When was the last time you saw them?
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	Around two weeks ago.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	Did they leave together?
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	No.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	He left first, the woman a couple of hours afterwards.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	Did they say anything to you?
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	They didn't.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	Anybody else asked you any questions about them?
Loge_Event32_Page1	Dalibor Branko	Not that I can remember.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Loge_Event32_Page1	Atlas	Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Rondham Central_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Wrong entrance.
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Something wrong?
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm not sure.
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But there's something in the air.
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Could be the sirocco.
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Maybe.
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So...
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Where to?
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You know where the Old Admirality is?
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Think it was on the eastern tail of the city, right?
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Spot on!
Rondham Central_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Rondham Central_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	...
Rondham Central_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Let's go.
Rondham Central_Event4_Page1	Abel Donati	Why the hell are they screening people all of a sudden?
Rondham Central_Event4_Page3	Abel Donati	Feels good to have the old crew back together.
Rondham Central_Event5_Page1	Leonidas Hardie	Yeah, they told me to get stuffed, as well.
Rondham Central_Event5_Page3	Leonidas Hardie	Man, our boys really showed them!
Rondham Central_Event6_Page1	Aran Gottlieb	As long as I'm with you, I don't mind.
Rondham Central_Event7_Page1	Larissa Kos	Aww...
Rondham Central_Event7_Page1	Larissa Kos	You're just too sweet!
Rondham Central_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Rondham Central_Event9_Page1	Ganymede	Coffee back on the menu!
Rondham Central_Event10_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Rondham Central_Event13_Page1	Nikolas Davison	Good day, sir!
Rondham Central_Event13_Page2	Nikolas Davison	Hey.
Rondham Central_Event14_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Rondham Central_Event15_Page3	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Nikolas Davison	Hello Sir.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Nikolas Davison	Your papers, please.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Uhh..
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	What should we do?
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Daphne	Guess we'll have to come back later.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I'm afraid we left them at home.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	We'll return later.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I'm afraid I left them at home.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I'll return later.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page1	Nikolas Davison	No problem at all, sir.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page2	Daphne	We still don't have our papers.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page2	Daphne	Let's return later.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	I still don't have my papers.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page3	Nikolas Davison	Hello Sir.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page3	Nikolas Davison	Your papers, please.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page3	Ganymede	There you go.
Rondham Central_Event16_Page3	Nikolas Davison	Thank you for your cooperation.
Rondham Central_Event17_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Rondham Central_Event18_Page1	Lykke Baines	Dude, I've just about had it with these Guardsmen...
Rondham Central_Event18_Page3	Lykke Baines	AmiTra! AmiTra!
Rondham Central_Event19_Page1	Franccois Caballero	Yo, I heard Olli got frisked, yesterday.
Rondham Central_Event19_Page3	Franccois Caballero	Fuck the Guardies.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	Hey there.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	You alright?
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah, I'm good.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Ganymede	Just my first time in the city.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	Yeah, this place really packs a heat during August.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	Make sure to drink a lot and keep yourself cool!
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Ganymede	Thanks, I'll do that.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	No problem, mate.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	Hope you have a good time here.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	And if you want to have a REALLY good time...
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	There's this brothel down in Karlin Street-
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Ganymede	I appreciate it, but I'm gonna have to pass on that.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page1	Milen Vasilev	It's your loss.
Rondham Central_Event20_Page2	Milen Vasilev	Hope you'll feel better, soon.
Rondham Central_Event21_Page1	Michael Shaughnessy	This is ridiculous!
Rondham Central_Event21_Page1	Michael Shaughnessy	If I'm not in Trenton within the next five minutes, I'll be ruined!
Rondham Central_Event21_Page3	Michael Shaughnessy	I know, right?
Rondham Central_Event21_Page3	Michael Shaughnessy	Even Heinrich's here with us.
Rondham Central_Event23_Page3	Ganymede	That's where he lives?
Rondham Central_Event23_Page3	Ganymede	Hmm...
Rondham Central_Event23_Page3	Ganymede	Might as well report back while I'm here.
Rondham Central_Event25_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I don't have time for sight-seeing.
Rondham Central_Event32_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Rondham Central_Event51_Page2	Ganymede	North/Northeast: Hudsman Corner East: Pike Bridge West: Trenton Plaza
Rondham Central_Event51_Page2	Eduard Kardos	Well, I'd take them over Faber, any day.
Rondham Central_Event51_Page2	Eduard Kardos	And besides, I heard De Bloom's with them, too.
Rondham Central_Event52_Page2	Gergely Hajós	Honestly, I'm not so sure.
Rondham Central_Event52_Page2	Gergely Hajós	Some people are saying that the Ionians have these guys by their balls.
Rondham Central_Event53_Page2	Hristofor Eszes	Right.
Rondham Central_Event53_Page2	Hristofor Eszes	I just hope there won't be any more bloodshed.
Rondham Central_Event54_Page2	Vladan Danchev	As long as they don't step on our toes, I don't care who's in charge.
Workshop_Event2_Page1	Yanis Shelton	Sorry, I'm quite busy here.
Workshop_Event3_Page1	Giorgio Romão	Top of the day to you.
Workshop_Event4_Page1	Fyfe Wendel	Who the hell put this in the chimney?
Workshop_Event5_Page1	Ilija Tadić	Seven hours without a break.
Workshop_Event5_Page1	Ilija Tadić	I can't take it anymore.
Workshop_Event6_Page1	Simão Daviau	Not allowed to talk at work, sorry.
Workshop_Event7_Page1	Ekber Kovalev	20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65...
Workshop_Event7_Page1	Ekber Kovalev	Wait a second...
Workshop_Event7_Page2	Ekber Kovalev	1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Giorgio Romão	Hey, you!
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Giorgio Romão	Have I seen you around here before?
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Ganymede	Who, me?
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Giorgio Romão	Yes, you!
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Ganymede	Sorry, was just having a look around.
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Giorgio Romão	Well, go loiter somewhere else.
Workshop_Event11_Page1	Giorgio Romão	There's people trying to work here, if you haven't noticed.
Workshop_Event11_Page2	Giorgio Romão	Are you deaf or something?
Workshop_Event11_Page2	Giorgio Romão	Sod off!
Workshop_Event11_Page3	Giorgio Romão	Good morning, Mr. Hendrick.
Workshop_Event11_Page3	Drenem Hendrick	And to you.
Workshop_Event11_Page3	Giorgio Romão	You're here to see Mr. Sternlein?
Workshop_Event11_Page3	Drenem Hendrick	I am.
Workshop_Event11_Page3	Giorgio Romão	Very well.
Workshop_Event11_Page3	Giorgio Romão	Feel free to go right in.
Town Hall_Event4_Page1	Wallace Krastev	Good morning, Sir!
Town Hall_Event4_Page1	Wallace Krastev	How can I help you?
Town Hall_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Is Mr. Faber in?
Town Hall_Event4_Page1	Wallace Krastev	He is.
Town Hall_Event4_Page1	Wallace Krastev	Do you have an appointment?
Town Hall_Event4_Page2	Wallace Krastev	Sir?
Town Hall_Event4_Page3	Wallace Krastev	Excuse me?!
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page1	Laurits Faber	What's the meaning of this?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page1	Laurits Faber	Who are you?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page1	Atlas	You know who I am.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Don't try to play games with me.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	You're earlier than expected.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	More importantly...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Would you mind explaining yourself?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	Excuse me?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	I'm sorry.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	But I had to do something.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	I received a facsimile from Amryn's ambassador, yesterday.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	They know about our arrangement.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	I had to prove that there wasn't any truth to it.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	It's not what we agreed on.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	That's open to interpretation.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	You made it in, after all.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	Didn't you?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Mr. Faber...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	I'm not here to discuss details.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	The matter of the fact is...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	You brought this situation on yourself.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	And we need to resolve it.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	What are you proposing?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	For one...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	We haven't received our papers.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	Of course.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	There you go.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Thank you.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	That matter being settled...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Your ploy lost us about half a day.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	We'll need extended access to make up for it.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	For what purpose?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	That is not your concern.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	Well, in that case...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	I'll have to refuse.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Mr. Faber...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	I thought a man of your rank would realize the situation he's been put into.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	Oh – I understand perfectly!
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	You think you can intimidate me!
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	But you're not in Ionia, anymore.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	That's not the point.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	The only thing that matters is whether you accept our terms or not.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	What if I don't?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	You'll have to reimburse.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Or we'll take this city by force.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	I could have you arrested on the spot for saying that.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Are you listening to me?
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Whether it's me, or someone else you're having this conversation with...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Is irrelevant.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	And if I'm compromised...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	So are you.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	One thing's for certain, though.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	We will take our share.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Through you, or someone else.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	Well, we'll see about that.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	In any case...
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Laurits Faber	I'll need some time to think this over.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	You have until six o'clock.
Mayor's Office_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Thank you for your time.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Wallace Krastev	I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor!
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Wallace Krastev	He charged right through me.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Wallace Krastev	I'll have him removed at once!
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Laurits Faber	There's no need for that.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Laurits Faber	I was expecting Mr. Lambert here.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Laurits Faber	That will be all, Mr. Krastev.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Wallace Krastev	O-of course!
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page2	Wallace Krastev	I'll be at the reception, if you need me.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page4	Laurits Faber	Enter.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page5	Laurits Faber	Any news?
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page5	Laurits Faber	Louis?
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page5	Louis Tanner	We found her.
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page5	Laurits Faber	Thank god...
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page5	Laurits Faber	How is she?
Mayor's Office_Event3_Page5	Louis Tanner	I think it's best if you see for yourself.
Hudsman Corner_Event1_Page2	Unknown	**Locked**
Hudsman Corner_Event1_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I should grab the Chario, first.

Hudsman Corner_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	I mustn't lose him.
Hudsman Corner_Event5_Page1	Markos Favero	How are we supposed to grab our papers if we can't get home?
Hudsman Corner_Event5_Page2	Markos Favero	Don't worry, my love.
Hudsman Corner_Event5_Page2	Markos Favero	I'm sure everything will be fine.
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page1	Natasza Janssen	Don't you hate tourists, as well?
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page1	Natasza Janssen	Only eyes for the big attractions.
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page2	Natasza Janssen	For me, it's all about these little alleys and their cute little shops!
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page4	Natasza Janssen	Tsk.
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page4	Natasza Janssen	I hate tourists.
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page5	Natasza Janssen	You're with me on this, right?
Hudsman Corner_Event6_Page7	Natasza Janssen	It's time for change.
Hudsman Corner_Event7_Page1	Catriona Antal	I knew we should've taken them with us...
Hudsman Corner_Event7_Page2	Catriona Antal	Will we ever be able to go home?
Hudsman Corner_Event10_Page1	Catriona Antal	*Locked*

Hudsman Corner_Event16_Page3	Ganymede	There you go.
Hudsman Corner_Event16_Page3	César Dreesen	Thank you for your cooperation.
Hudsman Corner_Event16_Page6	Dani Kató	Nah, man.
Hudsman Corner_Event16_Page6	Dani Kató	They don't got the numbers.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	César Dreesen	Hello Sir.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	César Dreesen	Your papers, please.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	Uhh..
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	What should we do?
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Daphne	Guess we'll have to come back later.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	I'm afraid we left them at home.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	We'll return later.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	I'm afraid I left them at home.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	I'll return later.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page1	César Dreesen	No problem at all, sir.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page2	Daphne	We still don't have our papers.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page2	Daphne	Let's return later.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page2	Ganymede	I still don't have my papers.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page3	César Dreesen	Hello Sir.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page3	César Dreesen	Your papers, please.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page3	Ganymede	There you go.
Hudsman Corner_Event17_Page3	César Dreesen	Thank you for your cooperation.
Hudsman Corner_Event18_Page1	Daphne	Hudsam Corner.
Hudsman Corner_Event18_Page1	Daphne	That big building over there is the district's central workshop.
Hudsman Corner_Event18_Page1	Daphne	And the seat of Rondham's administration.
Hudsman Corner_Event18_Page3	Ganymede	Now to find a spot where I can see who's passing by...
Hudsman Corner_Event18_Page3	Ganymede	Like that conveniently placed bench over there.
Hudsman Corner_Event19_Page1	Cherny Ivanov	Good day to you!
Hudsman Corner_Event19_Page2	Gusztáv Ubiña	We're in charge, now.
Hudsman Corner_Event20_Page2	Gusztáv Ubiña	**Locked**
Hudsman Corner_Event20_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I should get the Chario, first.
Hudsman Corner_Event22_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	**Locked**
Hudsman Corner_Event22_Page1	Barclay Kovalevr	Another eighteen hour shift!?
Hudsman Corner_Event22_Page1	Barclay Kovalev	Are these guys kidding me?
Hudsman Corner_Event22_Page2	Barclay Kovalevr	Heheheh.
Hudsman Corner_Event22_Page2	Barclay Kovalev	Who's laughing now, fuckhead?
Hudsman Corner_Event22_Page3	Barclay Kovalev	Hehehehe.
Hudsman Corner_Event26_Page1	Barclay Kovalev	*Locked*
Hudsman Corner_Event26_Page1	Alexina Blaise	I saw one of the sutlers in Clarin wearing exactly the same dress, I swear!
Hudsman Corner_Event26_Page2	Alexina Blaise	Who?
Hudsman Corner_Event27_Page5	Ganymede	Looks like he's heading to Rondham.
Hudsman Corner_Event27_Page7	Ganymede	I mustn't lose him.
Hudsman Corner_Event27_Page10	Drenem	The workshop is right over there.
Hudsman Corner_Event28_Page4	Ganymede	I mustn't lose him.
Hudsman Corner_Event28_Page7	Drenem	The workshop is right over there.
Hudsman Corner_Event29_Page4	Ganymede	I mustn't lose him.
Hudsman Corner_Event29_Page7	Drenem	The workshop is right over there.
Hudsman Corner_Event30_Page4	Ganymede	I mustn't lose him.
Hudsman Corner_Event30_Page7	Drenem	The workshop is right over there.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	Thought I saw you there.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Tillian was it, right?
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	Yeah.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	How's your stay in Trachi, so far?
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Pretty overwhelming, I've got to admit.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	It's a lot to take in, for sure!
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	What about you?
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Did you manage to take care of your stuff?
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	Yeah...
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	I guess you could say that.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	Looks like I'm gonna have to stay in the city for a while, though.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	So if you ever need a guide or anything, let me know.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Will do!
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Right, I gotta go.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	I'll see you around!
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	Yeah, for sure!
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Tillian Márton	Have a good one!
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Alright.
Hudsman Corner_Event31_Page2	Ganymede	Time to check out that alley, back there.
Hudsman Corner_Event32_Page1	Ganymede	And back to the waiting part.
Hudsman Corner_Event32_Page2	Ganymede	Oh?
Hudsman Corner_Event32_Page2	Ganymede	Someone seems to be in a rush.
Hudsman Corner_Event34_Page1	Žaneta Henriksson	No way!
Hudsman Corner_Event34_Page1	Žaneta Henriksson	Barkley or something.
Hudsman Corner_Event34_Page1	Žaneta Henriksson	I swear, she's rocking exactly the same style as you.
Hudsman Corner_Event34_Page2	Žaneta Henriksson	Yeah, that girl from Albion.
Hudsman Corner_Event34_Page2	Žaneta Henriksson	Barkley or something.
Hudsman Corner_Event34_Page2	Žaneta Henriksson	I swear, she's rocking exactly the same style as you.
Hudsman Corner_Event35_Page1	Gusztáv Ubiña	Oh, come on!
Hudsman Corner_Event35_Page1	Gusztáv Ubiña	We've just finished our shift...
Hudsman Corner_Event36_Page1	Lavrenty Capello	I'm sorry, man.
Hudsman Corner_Event36_Page1	Lavrenty Capello	But you know how she is...
Hudsman Corner_Event37_Page2	Ganymede	I mustn't lose him.
Hudsman Corner_Event38_Page1	Grigor McNeill	Sorry mate...
Hudsman Corner_Event38_Page1	Grigor McNeill	But I got my hands full here, as you can see.
Hudsman Corner_Event38_Page2	Grigor McNeill	Different boss, same work.
Hudsman Corner_Event38_Page2	Grigor McNeill	So yeah, I still got my hands full here, sorry.
Hudsman Corner_Event41_Page1	Grigor McNeill	*Locked* **Locked**
Hudsman Corner_Event41_Page1	Nicolai Weimann	Sometimes it feels like I'm doing the same thing every day.
Hudsman Corner_Event41_Page3	Nicolai Weimann	Yup.
Hudsman Corner_Event41_Page3	Nicolai Weimann	It's still there.
Hudsman Corner_Event46_Page1	Nicolai Weimann	North: Galson Alley East: Clarin Square Southeast: Pike Bridge Southwest: Rondham Central West: Trenton Plaza
Hudsman Corner_Event46_Page1	Lavrenty Capello	Honestly?
Hudsman Corner_Event46_Page1	Lavrenty Capello	I don't think I can take it anymore.
Hudsman Corner_Event47_Page1	Gusztáv Ubiña	Don't say that, man.
Hudsman Corner_Event47_Page1	Gusztáv Ubiña	You never know what tomorrow brings.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	Yo.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	Can I help you?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	All good!
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Just having a look around.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Don't let me keep you!
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	Heh.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	How much do you want?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	I'm sorry?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	Oh...
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	You're not here because of that?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	I guess not!
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	Alright.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Just out of interest...
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	What do you got?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	How do I know you're not one the Guardies?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	You don't.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	But there's one right over there.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Want to go and ask him?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Just kidding, of course!
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Not like he'd believe me, anyway.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Right?
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	Chario.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	I see.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	Thank you for sharing that with me.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	No problem, man.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Mihail Filep	And good luck.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page1	Ganymede	You too, friend.
Hudsman Corner_Event48_Page2	Mihail Filep	See you on the other side.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Atlas...
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Hm?
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Is there something you'd like to tell me?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	What are you talking about?
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Jesus...
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Do you think I'm stupid?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Of course not.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Then how about you tell me what the fuck's going on?
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	We're not going to that dam, are we?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	That's right.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	So...
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Where are we going?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Calpoli.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Huh?
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Why?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Because the entire thing with Fredrick Dam is nothing but a hoax.
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	And I won't let you die for something stupid like that.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Thanks, I guess...
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But that doesn't answer my question.
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Right.
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	The reason we're going to Calpoli...
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Is because it's the least guarded checkpoint of our border to Amryn.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	So what are we supposed to do there?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Nothing.
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Unless you want to.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Atlas...
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Stop speaking in riddles, already!
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I know you want to run away.
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Hell, I think everybody does, at this point.
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	So that's what it's all about?
Train_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	You want to get me out?
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Of course not.
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	That's why I said...
Train_Event1_Page1	Atlas	It's up to you.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Are we just gonna stare at each other the entire trip?
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	You feel like there's something we should talk about?
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	I'm not sure.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	But the silence is killing me.
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	We're almost there.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Yeah...
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	So...
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Have you made up your mind, yet?
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Nope.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Sometimes you really are an idiot.
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	What do you mean by that?
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Who are you doing this for?
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I'm doing this for me.
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Because if I didn't...
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I'd hate myself.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	So you're guilt-tripping yourself into this?
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Is that a bad thing?
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	I'm not one to judge.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Thanks, though.
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	For what?
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	For being honest with me.
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Whatever you say...
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	In any case...
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	I'm grateful.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Because you trying to prove a point...
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Means I get to spend more time with you.
Train_Event1_Page2	Atlas	You really are something else...
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Looks like we're there.
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	So what's it gonna be, Atlas?
Train_Event1_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Who is it?
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Are we just gonna stare at each other the entire trip?
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	You feel like there's something we should talk about?
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	I'm not sure.
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	But the silence is killing me.
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	We're almost there.
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Yeah...
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	So...
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Have you made up your mind, yet?
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Nope.
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Sometimes you really are an idiot.
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	What do you mean by that?
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Who are you doing this for?
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	I'm doing this for me.
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Because if I didn't...
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	I'd hate myself.
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	So you're guilt-tripping yourself into this?
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Is that a bad thing?
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	I'm not one to judge.
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Thanks, though.
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	For what?
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	For being honest with me.
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	Whatever you say...
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	In any case...
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	I'm grateful.
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Because you trying to prove a point...
Train_Event1_Page3	Lorna	Means I get to spend more time with you.
Train_Event1_Page3	Atlas	You really are something else...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Say, I have a question.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	You could at least look at me, you know.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Was that so hard?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I thought you wanted to ask me something.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Does she know about our little trip?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Not yet.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	What do you mean by that?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	She will find out, eventually.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Won't she be worried?
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Last time we spoke....
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Didn't go very well.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	I'd hate for her to be kept in the dark for too long.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	And yeah, I know...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	"It's safer if she doesn't know."
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	That's not the primary reason.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Your sister is more than able to take care of herself, I have no doubt about that.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Why keep it from her, then?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	You of all people should know...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	That she'd never let you go.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Not because her career and life are on the line.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	To be perfectly honest, she doesn't really care about herself a lot.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	But you, on the other hand?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	She would give everything just to keep you safe.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	That doesn't make sense.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	There's no way I would have let her stop me.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I doubt any of us would have been able to.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	But as I said...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	She's prepared to take the fall for you.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	The place you're headed, however...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	She won't be able to protect you there.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	The sheer arrogance...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	You can't really blame her.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	After all, you are a bit of a troublemaker.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	I'm sorry.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	But there's people who won't accept tyranny.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	No matter what it calls itself.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	I don't know how you can bear it.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	But I guess every trait has it's value at some point.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I'll take that as a compliment.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	You should.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I can't help it.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I owe it to Eury.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	It always come back to her, doesn't it?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Not for much longer.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Once you've crossed the border, you'll have to become a different person entirely.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	I know.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	It's a one-way trip...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	You can still turn back, you know?
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Nope.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	I've made up my mind.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Besides, you never know...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Perhaps one day I'll return.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	You'd put all of us in danger.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	That's not what I mean.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	I am talking about an Ionia that is free.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	And I know you can see it, too.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	You and my sister can go on and on about duty as much as you like.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	But both of you have long realized that you're playing a farce.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	This system can't be changed from the top.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Not behind closed doors.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	And not on the whim of a man whose only redeeming quality is to be victor of a power struggle.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	We've been over that a thousand times already.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	You were talking about values earlier, remember?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	There's value in recognizing that you've lost.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	In the end, we're just trying to survive.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	There's no point in sacking yourself just on the off chance that someone else might feel bad.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	And besides...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Why would you destroy a world in which you thrive?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Don't get me wrong.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I'm not enjoying this.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I can see the fear in their eyes once they realize who I'm working for.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	And I've had to do terrible things to people I held dear.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	But I'm a coward, you see...
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Take this profession away from me and I'd be nothing.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I can work people, because I know they're weak.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	But in truth, I think I'm the weakest of all of them.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	They've made a terrible choice once or twice in their life.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	And we make the ones to make sure that these missteps will continue to haunt them.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	But me?
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	I've got nothing to lose.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Because they made me this way.
Train_Event1_Page4	Atlas	There's nowhere for me to go but forward, you see?
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	You really are a dumbo, sometimes.
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	How about...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	Instead of blindly waltzing forward like a machine...
Train_Event1_Page4	Lorna	You just go wherever the hell you want?
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	I think this is it.
Train_Event1_Page5	Atlas	...
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	Time to make up your mind.
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	So...
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	What's it gonna be?
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	Damn, you really are indecisive.
Train_Event1_Page5	Atlas	What tells you that I haven't made up my mind already, long ago?
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	Well, if that's the case...
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	Would you mind sharing it with me, then?
Train_Event1_Page5	Lorna	Who is it?
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	Sorry about the disturbance.
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	Would you mind showing me your identification, please?
Train_Event2_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Of course!
Train_Event2_Page2	Lorna Faragó	Can never be to sure in these trying times, eh?
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	Hm...
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me.
Train_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Are you sure about that?
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	And who are you?
Train_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I'm in charge of her.
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	Yes, I've been informed of that.
Train_Event2_Page2	Atlas	So?
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	You need to come with me as well.
Train_Event2_Page2	Mitko Ivanovski	Be advised that I am instructed to use force, if necessary.
Interrogation Room Atlas_Event1_Page1	Crius	Leave.
Interrogation Room Atlas_Event1_Page2	Áron Kollias	EnKAD, huh?
Interrogation Room Atlas_Event1_Page2	Áron Kollias	I was wondering-
Interrogation Room Atlas_Event1_Page3	Áron Kollias	EnKaD, huh?
Interrogation Room Atlas_Event1_Page3	Áron Kollias	I was wondering-
eiro_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	...
eiro_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	W-what?
eiro_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	W-where am I?
eiro_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Wait a second...
eiro_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Am I...
eiro_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	...Home?
eiro_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	...
eiro_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Again?
eiro_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	What the fuck is going on with me?
eiro_Event1_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	...
eiro_Event1_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	Already?
eiro_Event1_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	Damn...
eiro_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Is that...
eiro_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Chiron?
eiro_Event2_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	...
eiro_Event3_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hmm...
eiro_Event3_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	There's letters here...
eiro_Event3_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	D-...
eiro_Event3_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Dea...
eiro_Event3_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I can't make them out.
eiro_Event3_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	It's no use.
eiro_Event3_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	D-...
eiro_Event3_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Dea...
eiro_Event3_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Dear.
eiro_Event3_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	G-ga...
eiro_Event3_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	...nymede?
eiro_Event3_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	Who wrote this?
eiro_Event3_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	I already know what it says.
eiro_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hmm..
eiro_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	The drawers are stuck.
eiro_Event4_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	Still won't open.
eiro_Event4_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Hm.
eiro_Event4_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	You really want to see this?
eiro_Event4_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Are you sure?
eiro_Event4_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Alright.
eiro_Event4_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Don't say I didn't warn you.
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	Anton was put down two days after that.
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	Because that's what happens to the things I love.
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	As for Apo...
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	Yeah, I killed him.
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	With my own hands.
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	I can still see the blood, when I close my eyes.
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	And now...
eiro_Event4_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	You've seen it, too.
eiro_Event4_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	It's empty.
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	How did it go?
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	...
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	Not good?
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Let's put it this way: These guys were so riled up...
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I almost joined them!
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	Nice going!
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Thanks!
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	How's the driver?
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	Pretty nervous.
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	But I guess that's to be expected.
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	And Forten?
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	Just finished his speech.
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	Should get underway, soon.
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Good.
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	We watching?
Chicken House_Event2_Page1	Icarus	You bet!
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	You're the new guy?
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	Yep.
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	Hm...
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	Something wrong?
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	How old are you?
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	That's none of your business.
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	Is that so?
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	Ganymede, was it, right?
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	Mhm.
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	Alright.
Chicken House_Event4_Page2	Icarus	I think you'll do.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	You think you can convince them?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Yeah.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	I've been to places likes this one.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	All it needs is a little nudge.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	We're talking about real people, here.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	I know.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	That's what makes it fun.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Right?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Oh, come on!
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	You're in this business, whether you like it, or not.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	And if we don't make a move, soon...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	We'll lose our chance.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	Doesn't mean you have to enjoy it.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	But it also doesn't make any difference.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	You think that guy, Forten...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Cares whether we grit our teeth?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	I wouldn't.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Face it.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	We're good at this.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	It's what we're made for.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Life is war.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	And we're survivors.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Just like our dear general.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	I'm not concerned about him.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Yeah, I get it.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	"These poor people..." They don't deserve it, right?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Granted, they probably don't.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	But they've put themselves in the line of fire.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	They're fanatics.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	And all we're doing...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Is to offer a bit of encouragement.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	My point is...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	This is happening, either way.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	So we might as well enjoy the ride.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	Hm...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	I gotta say...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	I underestimated you.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Join the queue.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	But there's a question on my mind.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Hit me.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	You like to put that innocent little act upfront.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	So what I'm speaking to right now...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	Is your second line of defense.
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	Now, I'm wondering...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	What's beyond that?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	So tell me...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Icarus	What's the real Ganymede like?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	That angle, really?
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	Okay...
Chicken House_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	You'll do.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	You sure you got everything?
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Come on, Iky...
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I'll be fine!
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	You're right.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	Think I'm just sad to see you go.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	But I guess nothing lasts forever.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Yup.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	It was fun, though!
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	And I'm sure we'll see each other again, sometime!
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	Yeah, about that...
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	I gotta tell you something.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I'm listening.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	There's a girl.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Oh, please!
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	You think it's the first time I'm doing this?
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I'm not gonna run around and tell every-
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	body!
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	It doesn't matter.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	So? What's the deal?
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	She's with EnKAD.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Oh.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	My condolences.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	She's got her own mind and everything.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	But she will find out.
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Okay?
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	So I think it's only fair...
Chicken House_Event5_Page1	Icarus	If you knew about her, too.
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Wilkert Forten	What's the meaning of this?
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Kilian Berger	Sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Kilian Berger	Please stay inside the carriage!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Wilkert Forten	Nonsense!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Wilkert Forten	Why did we stop?
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Kilian Berger	There's a cart blocking the road, sir.
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Wilkert Forten	So?
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Wilkert Forten	Move it, then!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Kilian Berger	Working on it, sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Icarus	Come on...
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Icarus	What's he waiting for?
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Ganymede	He'll do it, don't worry.
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Wilkert Forten	Is there a problem?
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Léo Gaspard	Sorry, sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Léo Gaspard	We'll have the road cleared, momentarily!
Durring Road_Event7_Page1	Dario Bellini	Hold it!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Icarus	Here we go.
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Ganymede	Let's hope this works.
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	General Forten	What's the meaning of this?
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	Sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	Please stay inside the carriage!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	General Forten	Nonsense!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	General Forten	Why did we stop?
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	There's a cart blocking the road, sir.
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	General Forten	So?
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	General Forten	Move it, then!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	Working on it, sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Icarus	Come on...
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Icarus	What's he waiting for?
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Ganymede	He'll do it, don't worry.
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	General Forten	Is there a problem?
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	Sorry Sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	We'll have the road cleared, momentarily!
Durring Road_Event7_Page2	Soldier	Hold it!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Icarus	Here we go.
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Ganymede	Let's hope this works.
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	General Forten	What's the meaning of this?
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	Sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	Please stay inside the carriage!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	General Forten	Nonsense!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	General Forten	Why did we stop?
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	There's a cart blocking the road, sir.
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	General Forten	Then move it!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	Working on it, sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Icarus	Come on...
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Icarus	What's he waiting for?
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Ganymede	He'll do it, don't worry.
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	General Forten	Is there a problem?
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	Sorry Sir!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	We'll have the road cleared, momentarily!
Durring Road_Event7_Page3	Soldier	Hold it!
Old Admirality _Event5_Page1	Ivan Donne	Hope you have a good day, sir.
Old Admirality _Event5_Page3	Ivan Donne	Hope you have a good day, sir.
Old Admirality _Event6_Page1	Zoja Falconer	So anyway, she basically told me that we might be stuck here for the next few days.
Old Admirality _Event6_Page2	Zoja Falconer	Agreed.
Old Admirality _Event6_Page2	Zoja Falconer	Might just make the best out of it and enjoy ourselves in the meantime.
Old Admirality _Event7_Page1	Brett Knežević	Yea, I heard so too.
Old Admirality _Event7_Page1	Brett Knežević	Though you know how much people like to gossip about these kind of things.
Old Admirality _Event7_Page2	Brett Knežević	Whatever might or might not happen, there's nowhere to run, anyway.
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	Are you serious?
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	I can't just wait "a few days"!
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	There's a market of people eager to buy over there, AND the biggest festival of the year coming up!
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	I got some A-class souvenirs and if people can't take it with them when they go home...
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	I'm not one to say, but you might have a riot on your hands.
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Jelka Darby	Now... I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Jelka Darby	Please check in with the custom's office if you have any complaints.
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	FINE!
Old Admirality _Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	Don't say I didn't warn you!
Old Admirality _Event9_Page2	Darius Swango	Bunch of imbeciles, all of them...
Old Admirality _Event9_Page3	Diogo Mayer	I'm moving up the ranks, baby!
Old Admirality _Event10_Page1	Jelka Darby	I can't make an exception, I'm afraid.
Old Admirality _Event10_Page2	Lenart Marjanović	Hm, I wonder if Svetlana likes this kind of stuff...
Old Admirality _Event15_Page1	Servant	Are you okay, my lady?
Old Admirality _Event15_Page1	Elegant Woman	I'm alright.
Old Admirality _Event15_Page1	Elegant Woman	Just a bit dizzy from the trip.
Old Admirality _Event15_Page1	Elegant Woman	Let's get the custom's procedure over with.
Old Admirality _Event15_Page1	Servant	Right away, my lady.
Old Admirality _Event16_Page1	Servant	Good day, sir.
Old Admirality _Event17_Page1	Kristina Remington	Oh, come on!
Old Admirality _Event17_Page1	Kristina Remington	Just one quick stroll...
Old Admirality _Event17_Page2	Kristina Remington	We don't have to buy anything, you know?
Old Admirality _Event18_Page1	Zétény Fekete	Move along, please.
Old Admirality _Event19_Page1	Valentin Van Niftrik	I'm sorry, sir!
Old Admirality _Event19_Page1	Valentin Van Niftrik	It was all there when we were on the ship, I swear!
Old Admirality _Event19_Page2	Valentin Van Niftrik	Feels good to be my own boss, now.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	This looks good.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	Might take a while before he's back, though.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	I should take care of everything else, before getting comfortable.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	Ready?
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	Man...
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	This sunset really is something else!
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Icarus	Here we go.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page2	Ganymede	Let's hope this works.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page3	Ganymede	Ready?
Old Admirality _Event23_Page3	Ganymede	Man...
Old Admirality _Event23_Page3	Ganymede	This sunset really is something else!
Old Admirality _Event23_Page3	Icarus	Here we go.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page3	Ganymede	Let's hope this works.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	Still nothing...
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	It's already gotten dark.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	I should probably head back.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	Not much chance of-
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	What the fuck?
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	Looks like I'm not the only one who heard it.
Old Admirality _Event23_Page4	Ganymede	I should go back and see how the others are doing.
Old Admirality _Event25_Page1	Ainsley Gouveia	And you're telling me that entire crate of Chario just vanished, hm?
Old Admirality _Event26_Page1	Flore Triggs	Move along, please.
Old Admirality _Event27_Page2	Martin Genkov	See?
Old Admirality _Event27_Page2	Martin Genkov	I always knew we could come to an agreement.
Old Admirality _Event28_Page1	Lazar Regenbogen	Listen up you little upstart...
Old Admirality _Event28_Page1	Lazar Regenbogen	I was here first.
Old Admirality _Event28_Page1	Lazar Regenbogen	So you better get off my jetty right now, or I'll have all of your shit thrown into the sea!
Old Admirality _Event28_Page2	Lazar Regenbogen	As long as you keep your word.
Old Admirality _Event29_Page1	Laura Ecclestone	You still owe me from last time, remember?
Old Admirality _Event30_Page1	Mojmír Bautista	Make sure to keep your eyes on your luggage!
Old Admirality _Event30_Page2	Mojmír Bautista	No need to panic!
Old Admirality _Event31_Page1	Edan Lučić	Yea, I heard so too.
Old Admirality _Event32_Page1	Bernadine Smits	Hmm...
Old Admirality _Event32_Page2	Bernadine Smits	Mhh...
Old Admirality _Event32_Page3	Bernadine Smits	Huh...
Old Admirality _Event32_Page4	Bernadine Smits	I see...
Old Admirality _Event32_Page5	Bernadine Smits	Seriously....
Old Admirality _Event32_Page5	Bernadine Smits	You got nothing better do?
Old Admirality _Event33_Page1	Diogo Mayer	Lift this up...
Old Admirality _Event33_Page1	Diogo Mayer	Put that down there...
Old Admirality _Event33_Page1	Diogo Mayer	Don't drink on the job...
Old Admirality _Event33_Page1	Diogo Mayer	Stop puking over the railing...
Old Admirality _Event33_Page1	Diogo Mayer	It's all so tiresome.
Old Admirality _Event33_Page2	Diogo Mayer	And they say that Ionians have it bad.
Old Admirality _Event34_Page1	Servant	Good day, sir.
Old Admirality _Event35_Page1	Pavle Holub	Apologies, but could you use the other door?
Old Admirality _Event39_Page1	Pavle Holub	Note to all non-citizens: Starting August the 24th, every foreigner must carry their visum with them at all times.
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Ganymede	Hm?
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Ganymede	We're already at the port?
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Daphne	Yeah.
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Daphne	Trachi is surprisingly compact.
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Ganymede	The big building over there...
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Ganymede	That's the Old Admirality?
Old Admirality _Event49_Page1	Daphne	The one and only.
Old Admirality _Event49_Page3	Ganymede	Alright.
Old Admirality _Event49_Page3	Ganymede	See if I can find a good vantage point.
Old Admirality _Event49_Page3	Ganymede	Next time, I'll bring a folding chair with me, I swear.
Old Admirality _Event51_Page1	Mathilda Jonker	This tarte au citron is the best I've ever had!
Old Admirality _Event52_Page1	Sara Leitner	The coffee is a bit too weak, for my taste.
Old Admirality _Event93_Page1	Sara Leitner	North: Clarin Square West: Pike Bridge
Old Admirality _Event93_Page1	Daniel Hornick	We're here to stay.
Old Admirality _Event94_Page1	Patrik Kovačić	Another day, another revolution.
Old Admirality _Event95_Page1	Dimitrij Dragić	For freedom!
Old Admirality _Event96_Page1	Bohdan Zupančič	Hang the oppressor!
Old Admirality _Event96_Page1	Bohdan Zupančič	Hang 'em high!
Old Admirality _Event97_Page1	Črt Ilić	Fuck the Guardies. Fuck Faber. Fuck Amryn.
Old Admirality _Event97_Page1	Črt Ilić	Fuck everyone who's not on our side.
Old Admirality _Event98_Page1	Kyriakos Georgiou	Who cares, man?
Old Admirality _Event98_Page1	Kyriakos Georgiou	All that stuff belongs to us now, anyway.
Old Admirality _Event99_Page1	Lyudmil Genadiev	Yo, keep your hands of those pralines!
Sigmund Plaza_Event1_Page1	Salvador Paris	Hey, comrade.
Sigmund Plaza_Event1_Page1	Salvador Paris	Have a nice day, citizen.
Sigmund Plaza_Event2_Page1	Constantin Sharpe	Word is that some guy literally waltzed in there and threatened the mayor.
Sigmund Plaza_Event2_Page2	Constantin Sharpe	Poor little Clara...
Sigmund Plaza_Event4_Page1	Eduard Hornick	No rest for the wicked, eh?
Sigmund Plaza_Event4_Page1	Eduard Hornick	Please behave yourself.
Sigmund Plaza_Event5_Page1	Emil Santos	Please keep your distance.
Sigmund Plaza_Event6_Page1	Raimo Asenov	Move along, please.
Sigmund Plaza_Event7_Page1	Ernest Reyer	Sorry, sir.
Sigmund Plaza_Event7_Page1	Ernest Reyer	The town hall will be reopened, shortly.
Sigmund Plaza_Event8_Page1	Oier Björk	Wait, what?
Sigmund Plaza_Event8_Page1	Oier Björk	Why?
Sigmund Plaza_Event11_Page1	Oier Björk	North: Anderson Park West: Laurel Bridge
Sigmund Plaza_Event11_Page1	Denis De Lorenzo	Yeah, it's weird...
Sigmund Plaza_Event11_Page1	Denis De Lorenzo	That's like the first time I see the town hall being closed.
Sigmund Plaza_Event11_Page2	Denis De Lorenzo	I guess everything makes sense now.
Sigmund Plaza_Event13_Page1	Fredrik Kalb	Sorry, no entry.
Sigmund Plaza_Event15_Page1	Eva Ionescu	They don't even let staff in, anymore.
Sigmund Plaza_Event15_Page2	Eva Ionescu	I guess that's what they get for fucking over their own people.
Sigmund Plaza_Event16_Page1	Alonzo Coghlan	Apologies.
Sigmund Plaza_Event16_Page1	Alonzo Coghlan	But the Prefecture's closed for citizens.
Sigmund Plaza_Event18_Page1	Eulália Ivanović	Really?
Sigmund Plaza_Event18_Page1	Eulália Ivanović	That's so unlike him...
Sigmund Plaza_Event18_Page1	Eulália Ivanović	I hope he's alright.
Sigmund Plaza_Event22_Page1	Gus Kersey	You didn't hear this from me, alright?
Sigmund Plaza_Event22_Page1	Gus Kersey	But I'd stay away from Laurel, for now.
Sigmund Plaza_Event23_Page1	Géraud Olmo	He cancelled our meeting.
Sigmund Plaza_Event23_Page1	Géraud Olmo	Apparently, something urgent came up.
Sigmund Plaza_Event29_Page1	Fredrik Kalb	Good day to you!
Sigmund Plaza_Event30_Page1	Alonzo Coghlan	Hello, sir.
Sigmund Plaza_Event31_Page1	Yannick Barre	I don't know what it is...
Sigmund Plaza_Event31_Page1	Yannick Barre	But something feels seriously off.
Sigmund Plaza_Event31_Page3	Yannick Barre	I knew it.
Sigmund Plaza_Event33_Page1	Mitko Warner	Please don't loiter.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Hm?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Yo!
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I was just on my way back.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Did you hear it, too?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Something must've happened at the checkpoint.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	How do you know?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Our deal in Nestville.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Oh!
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Right.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	And you?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Did you find anything?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Nope.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I followed the guy to the OA.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	But lost him there.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Hm.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	What's wrong?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Just wondering...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Daphne told me she gave you something.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Shit!
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I totally forgot about that.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	You still have it?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Yeah, right here.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Open it.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	You sure?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I can do it, if you don't want to.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	It's fine.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I'll do it.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Let's see...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Hm?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	It's... empty?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Figures.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I don't get it.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	She's testing you, Ganymede.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I've got a question for you.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	When you fell into the sewers, last night...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Was that planned?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Excuse me?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	You were pushed, weren't you?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Ganymede?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Accidents happen.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	"Triumvirate entrance confirmed." That's what the message said.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Amryn knows we're here?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Someone told them, Ganymede.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	And you think it's her?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Maybe.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Why?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Me and her...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Know each other.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Huh?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I took something away from her.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	A long time ago.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	So?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	If shit hits the fan...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I might as well not just go back.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Now, Ganymede...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I'll give you something special.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	A choice.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	I don't expect you to trust me.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	So I'll show it to you.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Show me what?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Daphne.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Let's go.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Where to?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Trenton Plaza.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	How would I know?
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Because of who you're working for.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	If you're implying that it's me...
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page4	Atlas	That's not what I meant.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Between the three of us, you're the outsider.
Pike Bridge_Event1_Page4	Atlas	And you've been out cold the entire morning, let's not forget.
Pike Bridge_Event4_Page1	Jessika Kevorkian	Good day to you!
Pike Bridge_Event4_Page4	Jessika Kevorkian	There's a storm coming.
Pike Bridge_Event5_Page1	Valentina Lévesque	Weather's really nice this time of the year, ain't it?
Pike Bridge_Event5_Page3	Valentina Lévesque	What's everyone so worked up about?
Pike Bridge_Event10_Page1	Valentina Lévesque	**Confiserie Alpeaux opening soon!** **Confiserie Alpeaux opening soon!**
Pike Bridge_Event10_Page1	Iulian Waldroup	Is this shop ever gonna open or what?
Pike Bridge_Event10_Page3	Iulian Waldroup	This is getting ridiculous!
Pike Bridge_Event15_Page1	Thomas Amerighi	Move along, please.
Pike Bridge_Event15_Page3	Vinko Zorić	Nothing to see here, friend.
Pike Bridge_Event29_Page1	Vinko Zorić	North: Hudsman Corner East: Old Admirality West: Rondham Central
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	About time one of you guys showed up!
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Do you have any idea-
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Greg?!
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Timo.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Or do you prefer 'Ganymede'?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Nevermind that.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	How about you tell me what the fuck's going on, instead?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	It's a long story.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	And we don't have a lot of time.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	So that's how it is, huh?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	First you fuck off with that EnKAD girl...
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	And now you won't even tell me why.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I'm sorry, Timo.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But it's vital that the IIS doesn't know what I'm up to.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	I could've come with you.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I wish.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But I need you to stay in your role for a bit longer.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	What's that supposed to mean?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Did Fero tell you about arteria?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	arteria?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Hm...
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Gregor...
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	I'm running out of patience, here.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Alright.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Let me bring you up to speed.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	In a few months, the IIS will send another group of operatives to Trachi.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Cool.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Maybe I should participate.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	And then go dark for two years, without telling you.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I'm sorry, Timo.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But I didn't have a choice.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah, whatever.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I think you should take part.
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Huh? Why?
Dusa_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Have you ever heard of an agent called Atlas?
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	Come in.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	Ganymede.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	Is something wrong?
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Sorry.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I'm still getting used to that handle.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	I can't really blame you.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	To be honest, I never understood the purpose behind those codenames, in the first place.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	But seeing as we're now in the same department as EnKaD...
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	There's not much we can do about it.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Yeah.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I've met a few of the people working there.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	They're something else, entirely.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	Well, you'll certainly see more of them in the immediate future.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Don't tell me...
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	I'm sorry.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	But the secretary has come up with a plan.
Dusa_Event1_Page2	Crius	And I'd rather send someone I can trust.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	So, these people I'm going to work with...
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Who are they?
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Pravoskos has personally chosen two agents from his former branch.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	This keeps getting better.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	One of them being a twelve-year veteran, going by the codename "Atlas" He's distinguished himself during the FPR insurgency in 1917.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	And thus helped Pravoskos become head of EnKaD.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Atlas, on the other hand, was seemingly content on working in the field.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Some people just can't live without the trill of it, I guess.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	In any case...
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	He's also been to Trachi before, two years ago.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Wait a minute...
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	You're saying that the guy EnKaD sent to get our people back...
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	That was him?
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Precisely.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	I never understood why we let them mettle in our affairs, like that.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	We had to.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	After all, one our operatives was a former member of EnKaD.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Working more or less directly for Pravoskos, at that.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	The operation went south though, didn't it?
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Correct.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	And to this day, I'm still lavishing in the memory of that smug smile vanishing from Pravoskos' face, for once.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	In any case, said operative remains one of the top agents in his field.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	And I would assume that he'll be able to draw from the networks he's established during his last venture into the city.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Alright.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Already sounds like I'm in way over my head...
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	But go on.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	What about the other one?
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	A young woman from the psychological division.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	She's also been to Trachi, but merely as an attaché.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Regardless, she as well has performed exceptionally in the past.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Have you ever heard about the Leucippus-Incident?
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	I read about it.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Wasn't he the enforcer that killed some guy he was supposed to bring in for questioning?
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Exactly.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	After being reprimanded by his CO, he went rogue and threatened to go public.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	So EnKaD sent someone to negotiate.
Dusa_Event1_Page3	Crius	Thirty-six hours later, Leucippus turned himself in.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Can I be blunt?
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	You should, always.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	What you're proposing...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	It's treason.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	That depends on where your loyalties are.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Isn't that what they always say?
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	Perhaps.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	But I think you'll agree that something needs to be done.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Still...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	If word of that comes out...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	I am aware of that.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Well, you've got a lot more to lose than I do.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	But I'm not sure whether I can do this.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I've never been to that city.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	And it's going to be me against everyone else.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	What are you saying?
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	There's someone else working towards the same goal.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Who?
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	I don't know his identity.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	But the information he relayed has proven to be on point, so far.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Hm...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	What if it's a scheme by Pravoskos?
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	It's certainly a possiblity.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	But it would be highly uncharacteristic of him.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Still...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	Listen, Ganymede.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	I wouldn't put this on you if I wasn't one hundred percent certain of your abilities.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	These people from EnKaD...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	They're used to be in control of their environment.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	In Ionia, no one can touch them.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	So I would assume that they can't help but bring a sense of complacency with them.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	You on the other hand...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	You've been able to adapt to almost any environment, so far.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	And it is my firm belief that you can turn your limited experience in Trachi to your advantage.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	In other words...
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	Let them be in control, if they want.
Dusa_Event1_Page4	Crius	But try to be a nuisance at every opportunity.
Admin_Event5_Page1	Beniamin Cojocaru	Good day sir!
Admin_Event5_Page2	Beniamin Cojocaru	How may I help you?
Admin_Event5_Page3	Beniamin Cojocaru	I'm afraid I can't let you through without an appointment.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Beniamin Cojocaru	Good day sir!
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	Likewise!
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	Say, I was wondering if you could help me...
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	The thing is, I have an urgent meeting in town...
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	But every counter is occupied at the moment...
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	So I was curious if you've got any extra personnel available?
Admin_Event5_Page4	Beniamin Cojocaru	I'm sorry, sir.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Beniamin Cojocaru	But I'm afraid we don't have anyone to spare.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	I see.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	That's unfortunate.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Beniamin Cojocaru	I'm sure one of our employees can be with you shortly.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Beniamin Cojocaru	Feel free to make yourself comfortable in the waiting lounge, until then.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	Alright.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	I'll go and wait there then.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	Thanks for your assistance, though.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Beniamin Cojocaru	No problem at all, sir.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	Hm.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	Guess that's the end of the road, for now.
Admin_Event5_Page4	Ganymede	I should wait outside and see if he comes back.
Admin_Event5_Page5	Beniamin Cojocaru	Hope you have a pleasant stay.
Admin_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Oh no...
Admin_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	I have a bad feeling about this.
Admin_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Don't worry!
Admin_Event6_Page1	Daphne	This won't take long.
Admin_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	I'll take your word on that.
Admin_Event6_Page1	Daphne	There's a waiting area over there if you want to sit down.
Admin_Event6_Page1	Daphne	In any case, I'll be back in a sec.
Admin_Event6_Page3	Ganymede	Hm...
Admin_Event6_Page3	Ganymede	Where did he go?
Admin_Event7_Page1	Franz Gobel	Would you mind keeping your distance?
Admin_Event8_Page1	Dannie Geelen	Stop pushing!
Admin_Event8_Page3	Man	Excuse me.
Admin_Event9_Page1	Ferdinand Lovell	Get in line, please.
Admin_Event10_Page2	Daphne	Almost there.
Admin_Event11_Page1	Ganymede	I should wait for Daphne.
Admin_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	I should wait for Daphne.
Admin_Event13_Page1	Ganymede	I should wait for Daphne.
Admin_Event14_Page1	Ganymede	I should wait for Daphne.
Admin_Event16_Page1	Ivan Marko	Top of the day to you!
Admin_Event16_Page2	Grega Perko	Sorry, lass.
Admin_Event16_Page2	Grega Perko	But the shop's closed, at the moment.
Admin_Event22_Page2	Daphne	I'll see you later.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Ganymede	Boy, do I hope she's right.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Looks like you were right, after all.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Ganymede	What do you mean?
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Well...
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	The guy I needed to speak to is on lunch break.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	So I guess I'm gonna have to wait until he's back.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Ganymede	It's that important?
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	No need to wait on me, though.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Actually, could you do me a favour and drop this off at our place?
Admin_Event23_Page2	Ganymede	That letter?
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Our man left it behind.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Ganymede	Alright.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Ganymede	I'll see you later, then.
Admin_Event23_Page2	Daphne	Yup!
Admin_Event24_Page1	Ganymede	Boy, do I hope she's right.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Looks like you were right, after all.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Ganymede	What do you mean?
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Well...
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	The guy I needed to speak to is on lunch break.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	So I guess I'm gonna have to wait until he's back.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Ganymede	It's that important?
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Yeah.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	No need to wait on me, though.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Actually, could you do me a favour and drop this off at our place?
Admin_Event24_Page1	Ganymede	That letter?
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Yeah.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Our man left it behind.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Ganymede	I'll see you later, then.
Admin_Event24_Page1	Daphne	Yup!
Admin_Event25_Page2	Daphne	Almost there.
Admin_Event26_Page1	Ida Vincze	Welcome to the custom's office!
Admin_Event26_Page2	Veselin Korošec	Can't believe they made me work the reception...
Admin_Event27_Page1	Gabriel Klement	Please don't loiter.
Admin_Event27_Page2	Vasko Živković	Trachi forever!
Admin_Event28_Page1	Kristián Gavrilović	Don't cause any trouble.
Admin_Event29_Page1	Mirek Golob	Hey there.
Clarin Square_Event4_Page1	Reinout Gjorgiev	I'm not sure.
Clarin Square_Event4_Page1	Reinout Gjorgiev	I heard the previous stall-owner got his license revoked after some people got food poisoning.
Clarin Square_Event4_Page2	Reinout Gjorgiev	Really?
Clarin Square_Event4_Page2	Reinout Gjorgiev	That's all you have to say?
Clarin Square_Event4_Page3	Reinout Gjorgiev	Yeah, if it weren't for the bridge being closed...
Clarin Square_Event4_Page3	Reinout Gjorgiev	I would've almost thought I dreamed all of that up.
Clarin Square_Event4_Page4	Reinout Gjorgiev	You say that.
Clarin Square_Event4_Page4	Reinout Gjorgiev	But can you prove it?
Clarin Square_Event5_Page1	Sylvaine Irvin	Everytime I go to the market, I'm thinking of the things I'm gonna buy.
Clarin Square_Event5_Page1	Sylvaine Irvin	But I'm really not good with choices.
Clarin Square_Event6_Page2	Marija Kramář	Can't believe you still insist on wearing that ridiculous outfit You're really something else...
Clarin Square_Event7_Page1	Kostas Snijder	It's an heirloom from my great-grandfather!
Clarin Square_Event7_Page1	Kostas Snijder	Besides, you never know when some extra protection might come in handy.
Clarin Square_Event8_Page1	Iwo Coburn	Listen, I know my goods are kinda pricey.
Clarin Square_Event8_Page1	Iwo Coburn	But you wouldn't wanna be stingy when it comes to food, right?
Clarin Square_Event8_Page2	Iwo Coburn	Well, whatever it was...
Clarin Square_Event8_Page2	Iwo Coburn	It's probably a good idea to stock up on groceries.
Clarin Square_Event8_Page3	Iwo Coburn	Well, whatever it was...
Clarin Square_Event8_Page3	Iwo Coburn	It's probably a good idea to stock up on groceries.
Clarin Square_Event8_Page4	Iwo Coburn	No, don't worry.
Clarin Square_Event8_Page4	Iwo Coburn	I'm not one of them.
Clarin Square_Event9_Page1	Victor Messana	I'm not so sure...
Clarin Square_Event9_Page1	Victor Messana	Heard some people got real sick from that stuff.
Clarin Square_Event9_Page2	Victor Messana	Yeah, we should get ready, too.
Clarin Square_Event9_Page3	Victor Messana	Around half of them, I think.
Clarin Square_Event9_Page3	Victor Messana	We really need to be careful, though.
Clarin Square_Event9_Page4	Victor Messana	Well, I'm not gonna let go of mine, for sure!
Clarin Square_Event10_Page1	Roffe Milton	Yo, this "pineapple" or whatever they call it...
Clarin Square_Event10_Page1	Roffe Milton	You should totally give it a shot!
Clarin Square_Event10_Page2	Roffe Milton	I sure hope they're alright over there.
Clarin Square_Event10_Page3	Roffe Milton	Groni told me that his delivery got through, too.
Clarin Square_Event10_Page4	Roffe Milton	You think they're gonna let us keep our uniforms?
Clarin Square_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	These are the markets?
Clarin Square_Event15_Page1	Daphne	Spot on!
Clarin Square_Event16_Page1	Sasho Sierżant	Can I interest you in some of the finest garlic and pepper that the southern shores have to offer?
Clarin Square_Event16_Page3	Sasho Sierżant	Can I interest you in some of the finest rhadishes from Calpoli?

Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	Yes, I'm talking to you!
Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	Look at those over there!
Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	Juicy, aren't they?
Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	You know what they call these down in Katakan, where they come from?
Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	WATERMELONS!
Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	That's right!
Clarin Square_Event22_Page1	Marisa Christians	These bad boys pack as much water as you could drink in a day!

Clarin Square_Event23_Page1	Susanne Barkley	You look like you enjoy the occassional drink!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page2	Susanne Barkley	How about a little tasting~?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Oh, Mr. Hendrick!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	I didn't expect you to be here, so soon.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Lily more or less drove me out of the house once she heard about the chario.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	It is a brilliant sort, to be fair!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Quite right.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	But also an aquired taste.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Would you mind giving me a bottle of Laronde, just in case?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	'96, preferably.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	You're a very lucky man.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	It just arrived, this morning.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	There it is.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Thank you.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Oh, and the Chario, please.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Right!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Any specific vintage?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	'13, if you have it.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	I'll go and take a look.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	I'm terribly sorry...
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	But there's only '14 and '19 here.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Which one do you recommend?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	If you're going to as close as possible to '13, then '19 is your best bet.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Dry summers, both of them.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Alright.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	I'll take that one, then.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Oh, and please notify me if you get a hold on '13.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Of course!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Do you want me to put these in a bag for you?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	It's fine.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	One of them is for a friend, anyway.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	I'm sure he'll be very satisfied.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	How much do I owe you?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Let me think...
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	85 Trachma, in total.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	There you go.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Thank you for your business!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Susanne Barkley	Hope you'll have a nice Reclamation Day!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	You, as well.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page5	Susanne Barkley	See you soon, Mr. Hendrick.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Susanne Barkley	Hello, Mrs.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Susanne Barkley	Can I interest you in a glass?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Daphne	Very kind of you.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Daphne	But I'll have to pass, I'm afraid.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Susanne Barkley	What about an entire bottle, then?
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Daphne	Still a no, sorry!
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Susanne Barkley	Aww.
Clarin Square_Event23_Page6	Susanne Barkley	Alright.
Clarin Square_Event24_Page1	Susanne Barkley	You know where to find me, if you change your mind~ I'll be here all day~
Clarin Square_Event24_Page1	Viljam Gelens	Why is no one buying anything?
Clarin Square_Event24_Page1	Viljam Gelens	I invested so much to get this spot here.
Clarin Square_Event24_Page1	Viljam Gelens	My apologies!
Clarin Square_Event24_Page1	Viljam Gelens	I didn't see you there.
Clarin Square_Event24_Page1	Viljam Gelens	Might I interest you in some herbs, medicine, or even jewelry?
Clarin Square_Event24_Page2	Viljam Gelens	For god's sake, buy something, please!
Clarin Square_Event24_Page3	Vincent Pavlovski	Yo!
Clarin Square_Event24_Page3	Vincent Pavlovski	I've got some of the good stuff, if you know what I mean.
Clarin Square_Event25_Page1	Hervey Albrektson	How many times I gotta tell you, Mark?
Clarin Square_Event25_Page1	Hervey Albrektson	You can't just berth here without a good reason!
Clarin Square_Event25_Page2	Civil Guard	I'm sorry, but you really got to leave, now.
Clarin Square_Event25_Page3	Terrell Breda	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event26_Page1	Mark Hermansson	I'm sorry, really.
Clarin Square_Event26_Page1	Mark Hermansson	But you know how my back is.
Clarin Square_Event26_Page1	Mark Hermansson	I can't carry all that stuff over to Rondham just by myself.
Clarin Square_Event26_Page2	Mark Hermansson	I'll just be on my way and get someone to help me next time, okay?
Clarin Square_Event26_Page3	Mark Hermansson	Not before I get my stuff from the markets!
Clarin Square_Event26_Page4	Mark Hermansson	Where did Hervey go?
Clarin Square_Event28_Page1	Bartosz Horn	Sometimes I really want to shove you into one of those channels, man...
Clarin Square_Event29_Page1	Vasco Bartolomeo	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event29_Page2	Vasco Bartolomeo	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event31_Page1	Terrell Breda	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event31_Page2	Terrell Breda	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event34_Page1	Sergei Linden	You know what they say about the Trachian markets, right?
Clarin Square_Event34_Page1	Sergei Linden	Neither do I.
Clarin Square_Event41_Page1	Josué Lippi	Move along, please!
Clarin Square_Event41_Page2	Josué Lippi	Move along, please!
Clarin Square_Event42_Page1	Josef Báthory	Please stay back.
Clarin Square_Event42_Page2	Josef Báthory	Please stay back.
Clarin Square_Event43_Page1	Keenan Sterling	Apologies for the inconvenience!
Clarin Square_Event43_Page2	Keenan Sterling	Apologies for the inconvenience!
Clarin Square_Event44_Page2	Terrell Breda	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event45_Page2	Terrell Breda	The bridge will be reopened at the earliest opportunity.
Clarin Square_Event46_Page1	Florine Daalman	Looks like it's serious.
Clarin Square_Event47_Page1	Coen Samuel	The world's really gone to shit, eh?
Clarin Square_Event48_Page1	Susanne Barkley	I'm scared, Henry.
Clarin Square_Event49_Page1	Pascal Léandre	Don't worry my love.
Clarin Square_Event49_Page1	Pascal Léandre	I'm sure everything's alright!
Clarin Square_Event50_Page1	Sasho Sierżant	I can't believe they've closed off the exit!
Clarin Square_Event50_Page1	Sasho Sierżant	How am I gonna explain that to her...
Clarin Square_Event51_Page1	Irvine Fèvre	Probably just the Guard trying to bring people back in line.
Clarin Square_Event51_Page2	Irvine Fèvre	Nah, man.
Clarin Square_Event51_Page2	Irvine Fèvre	I really gotta go and catch some sleep.
Clarin Square_Event52_Page1	Aleksander Kruger	Maybe.
Clarin Square_Event52_Page1	Aleksander Kruger	But still, something like that has never happened, before.
Clarin Square_Event52_Page2	Aleksander Kruger	You sure?
Clarin Square_Event52_Page2	Aleksander Kruger	I'm just gonna pull through until tonight.
Clarin Square_Event53_Page1	Cosme Červenka	How I am supposed to sell my stuff when everyone's so focussed on something else, entirely?
Clarin Square_Event54_Page1	Reuben Hobbes	My brother works at the checkpoint.
Clarin Square_Event54_Page1	Reuben Hobbes	I sure hope he's alright...
Clarin Square_Event55_Page1	Grady Allegro	My cousin was supposed to arrive an hour ago...
Clarin Square_Event55_Page2	Grady Allegro	Yeah, some people even tried to swim through the river, out of desperation.
Clarin Square_Event55_Page2	Grady Allegro	Can you believe that?
Clarin Square_Event56_Page1	Endrit Braddock	He's still stuck at the checkpoint?
Clarin Square_Event56_Page2	Endrit Braddock	I'm not sure.
Clarin Square_Event56_Page2	Endrit Braddock	My aunt wrote me a letter yesterday, saying that the queue at the checkpoint get's longer and longer, each day.
Clarin Square_Event57_Page1	Petar Gagne	I bet the Ionians did this!
Clarin Square_Event79_Page1	Antton Cruickshank	Don't worry!
Clarin Square_Event79_Page1	Antton Cruickshank	I'm sure he's fine.
Clarin Square_Event80_Page1	Gun Lefèvre	Man, I sure hope Mark's alright.
Clarin Square_Event81_Page1	Ranulph Valentini	Sorry, sir!
Clarin Square_Event81_Page1	Ranulph Valentini	The bridge is temporarily closed.
Clarin Square_Event82_Page1	Matthieu Benedetti	Thought they'd started the fireworks a few days early, at first.
Clarin Square_Event83_Page1	Terrell Breda	Sorry, Sir!
Clarin Square_Event83_Page1	Terrell Breda	But the bridge is closed, for now.
Clarin Square_Event83_Page2	Peti Bodnár	Sorry, mate!
Clarin Square_Event83_Page2	Guardsman	Bridge's closed, for now.
Clarin Square_Event84_Page1	Terrell Breda	Sorry, Sir!
Clarin Square_Event84_Page1	Terrell Breda	But the bridge is closed, for now.
Clarin Square_Event84_Page2	Peti Bodnár	Sorry, mate!
Clarin Square_Event84_Page2	Guardsman	Bridge's closed, for now.
Clarin Square_Event85_Page1	Terrell Breda	Sorry, Sir!

Clarin Square_Event85_Page2	Peti Bodnár	Sorry, mate!
Clarin Square_Event85_Page2	Guardsman	Bridge's closed, for now.
Clarin Square_Event89_Page1	Guardsman	East: Eastern Checkpoint South: Old Admirality West: Hudsman Corner
Clarin Square_Event89_Page1	Atlas	We should finish our business here, first.
Gharten Street_Event2_Page1	Šimon Ivers	I saw Larry go in there, yesterday.
Gharten Street_Event2_Page1	Šimon Ivers	But he didn't want to talk about it.
Gharten Street_Event2_Page2	Šimon Ivers	What are they gonna do to the Ionian embassy now?
Gharten Street_Event5_Page1	Marcelinho Nigel	Seriously?
Gharten Street_Event5_Page1	Marcelinho Nigel	You've never stepped foot into the Parliament?
Gharten Street_Event5_Page1	Marcelinho Nigel	There's a session scheduled for tomorrow.
Gharten Street_Event5_Page1	Marcelinho Nigel	Maybe the two of us could go and watch it, for a bit.
Gharten Street_Event5_Page2	Marcelinho Nigel	It's a date, then!
Gharten Street_Event5_Page4	Marcelinho Nigel	God, I miss Suzana.
Gharten Street_Event6_Page1	Woman	I heard there's some new staff working at the embassy...
Gharten Street_Event6_Page1	Woman	One of them's supposed to be a real lady-killer.
Gharten Street_Event6_Page2	Woman	Mhhh...
Gharten Street_Event6_Page2	Woman	I wonder if they're still looking for people working the kitchen.
Gharten Street_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I should see where he's going.
Gharten Street_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the embassy.
Gharten Street_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the Admirality.
Gharten Street_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	This looks good.
Gharten Street_Event17_Page1	Ganymede	Think I'll have another look around first, though.
Gharten Street_Event17_Page2	Ganymede	Is it time?
Gharten Street_Event17_Page3	Ganymede	Let's see what's what.
Gharten Street_Event18_Page1	Ganymede	First house to the right, he said.
Gharten Street_Event18_Page1	Ganymede	This should be it, then.
Gharten Street_Event18_Page1	Ganymede	Now to find a good spot to watch it from.
Gharten Street_Event19_Page1	Gunvor Guerrero	Entry for embassy staff and visitors.
Gharten Street_Event19_Page2	Embassy Guard	I'm sorry sir, no entry.
Gharten Street_Event19_Page2	Atlas	We have an appointment with Mr. Werter.
Gharten Street_Event19_Page2	Atlas	Here's our invitation.
Gharten Street_Event19_Page2	Embassy Guard	Oh, I see.
Gharten Street_Event19_Page2	Embassy Guard	I'll open the gates for you.
Gharten Street_Event24_Page1	Leonard Gensch	Yeah, there's been a lot of people coming and going, lately.
Gharten Street_Event24_Page1	Leonard Gensch	Like, is that an embassy, or a night-club?
Gharten Street_Event24_Page2	Leonard Gensch	Beats me.
Gharten Street_Event24_Page2	Leonard Gensch	They'll probably give it to the Etrurians, or something.
Gharten Street_Event25_Page3	Ganymede	First catch of the day.
Gharten Street_Event25_Page3	Ganymede	I wonder where he's going.
Gharten Street_Event26_Page1	Ganymede	I should see where he's going.
Gharten Street_Event26_Page1	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the embassy.
Gharten Street_Event26_Page2	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the Admirality.
Gharten Street_Event29_Page2	Paskal Achthoven	Yeah!
Gharten Street_Event29_Page2	Paskal Achthoven	It's a very old building, dating back to 1648.
Gharten Street_Event29_Page2	Paskal Achthoven	You should see it at night!
Gharten Street_Event29_Page2	Paskal Achthoven	If you're free later, we could have a look at together.
Gharten Street_Event30_Page1	Takis Michelakos	Keep your distance, please.
Gharten Street_Event31_Page1	Stefan Petrovski	Sorry sir, the embassy is off-limits.
Gharten Street_Event32_Page2	Suzana Monet	Oh!
Gharten Street_Event32_Page2	Suzana Monet	That's Amryn's embassy over there!?
Gharten Street_Event33_Page1	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the embassy.
Gharten Street_Event33_Page1	Ganymede	I should follow him.
Gharten Street_Event33_Page2	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the Admirality.
Gharten Street_Event34_Page1	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the embassy.
Gharten Street_Event34_Page1	Ganymede	I should follow him.
Gharten Street_Event34_Page2	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the Admirality.
Gharten Street_Event35_Page1	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the embassy.
Gharten Street_Event35_Page1	Ganymede	I should follow him.
Gharten Street_Event35_Page2	Ganymede	I should keep an eye on the Admirality.
Gharten Street_Event36_Page1	Suzana Monet	Oh!
Gharten Street_Event36_Page1	Suzana Monet	That's the parliament, down there!?
Gharten Street_Event37_Page2	Middle-aged Man	Where the hell is he?
Gharten Street_Event38_Page1	Earnestine Schuster	Wow!
Gharten Street_Event38_Page1	Earnestine Schuster	They really have it good in Ionia, don't they?
Gharten Street_Event38_Page2	Earnestine Schuster	I know a few words of Graikos, back from school.
Gharten Street_Event38_Page2	Earnestine Schuster	You think they'd let me in if I told them I'm on their side?
Gharten Street_Event39_Page1	Sara Pereyra	Uhh...
Gharten Street_Event39_Page1	Sara Pereyra	I'm not so sure.
Gharten Street_Event39_Page2	Sara Pereyra	Are you insane?
Gharten Street_Event39_Page2	Sara Pereyra	They'd probably shoot you before you can even open your mouth.
Gharten Street_Event40_Page1	Samuel Tomić	Yeah, I'm a bit worried about Lily.
Gharten Street_Event40_Page1	Samuel Tomić	Seems like Drenem is a bit overprotective in regards to her.
Gharten Street_Event41_Page1	Ben Bristow	Agreed!
Gharten Street_Event41_Page1	Ben Bristow	I don't know when I saw her leave the house the last time.
Gharten Street_Event44_Page1	Ben Bristow	East: Trenton Plaza West: Filmore Avenue
Gharten Street_Event44_Page1	Miomir Orbán	Please move along.
Trenton Plaza_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event6_Page1	Juste Bonomo	Twenty-eight degrees and rising...
Trenton Plaza_Event6_Page1	Juste Bonomo	How can people enjoy this heat?
Trenton Plaza_Event6_Page2	Juste Bonomo	Finally a bit of a breeze.
Trenton Plaza_Event6_Page3	Juste Bonomo	And here's the calm before the storm.
Trenton Plaza_Event11_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event12_Page1	Carl Fuchs	I thought you said you didn't want to have dinner, yet?
Trenton Plaza_Event12_Page1	Carl Fuchs	Like, literally, five minutes ago...
Trenton Plaza_Event14_Page2	Eurydice	...
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Eurydice	Hm?
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Eurydice	Excuse me.
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Eurydice	What happened here?
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Sérgio Van der Ven	Some folks saying that there's been a murder.
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Eurydice	Is that so...
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Zuza Bartoš	Look, Sérgio!
Trenton Plaza_Event15_Page1	Zuza Bartoš	Something's happening.
Trenton Plaza_Event16_Page1	Manuel Engel	I wonder...
Trenton Plaza_Event16_Page1	Manuel Engel	Do you think I can make the swim all the way over to Rondham?
Trenton Plaza_Event16_Page2	Manuel Engel	Hmm...
Trenton Plaza_Event16_Page2	Manuel Engel	It's not THAT far, really...
Trenton Plaza_Event16_Page4	Manuel Engel	Yup.
Trenton Plaza_Event16_Page4	Manuel Engel	Today's the day.
Trenton Plaza_Event17_Page1	Rikard Dunkel	Hm?
Trenton Plaza_Event17_Page1	Rikard Dunkel	Oh, don't mind me.
Trenton Plaza_Event17_Page2	Rikard Dunkel	I meant what I said.
Trenton Plaza_Event17_Page4	Rikard Dunkel	A city torn.
Trenton Plaza_Event17_Page4	Rikard Dunkel	And a people divided against their will.
Trenton Plaza_Event20_Page1	Karīna Arrighi	I'm sorry Carl...
Trenton Plaza_Event20_Page1	Karīna Arrighi	But I wasn't hungry, back then.
Trenton Plaza_Event25_Page1	Woman	I heard she enrolled in Horchie university.
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page1	Heta Freeman	Look at how embarrasing these two are!
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page1	Heta Freeman	It's pathetic, isn't it?
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page1	Heta Freeman	Imagine being so utterly captivated that your entire body yearns for nothing more but the gentle touch of that one special person....
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page1	Heta Freeman	Haha...
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page2	Heta Freeman	I'm not crying, I swear!
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page3	Heta Freeman	And the rain keeps on falling.
Trenton Plaza_Event26_Page3	Heta Freeman	As my misery becomes too much for me to bear.
Trenton Plaza_Event27_Page1	Woman	What's Rudy up to, these days?
Trenton Plaza_Event30_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event31_Page1	Miklavž Kurucz	Sir, this is your last warning.
Trenton Plaza_Event31_Page1	Miklavž Kurucz	Clear the road, or we'll have to confiscate your cart.
Trenton Plaza_Event32_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event33_Page1	Demétrio Guarneri	Claire...
Trenton Plaza_Event33_Page1	Demétrio Guarneri	Just let me hold you in my arms, once more.
Trenton Plaza_Event33_Page3	Demétrio Guarneri	What are we, but faint petals dancing in the breeze?
Trenton Plaza_Event34_Page1	Maria Clifton	Please dear god, let this moment go on forever.
Trenton Plaza_Event34_Page3	Maria Clifton	And a whispered pledge, to never ever let go of one another.
Trenton Plaza_Event36_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Trenton Plaza_Event37_Page1	Artur Kinley	How is it my fault that the roads aren't paved, properly?
Trenton Plaza_Event59_Page1	Artur Kinley	Southeast: Rondham Central Southwest: Anderson Park Northwest: Gharten Street Northeast: Hudsman Corner
Trenton Plaza_Event59_Page1	Aleš Lukić	You know what I think?
Trenton Plaza_Event59_Page1	Aleš Lukić	We should just go over there and get it over with.
Trenton Plaza_Event60_Page1	Darko Vlašič	Maybe.
Trenton Plaza_Event60_Page1	Darko Vlašič	Let's wait for the mayor to hold his speech, though.
Trenton Plaza_Event61_Page1	Iosif Lengyel	I doubt they'll last more than a few days, anyway.
Trenton Plaza_Event64_Page1	Yordan Krajnc	Only if it's someone from their side, of course!
Trenton Plaza_Event65_Page1	Aleš Lukić	You're telling me to open fire if anyone tries to cross?
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	A bit unusual, isn't it?
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	But not unheard of.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Right.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You do understand, though, that there's going to be a lot of scepticism.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I am aware of that.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	And I intend to prove it wrong.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Good.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	We already have more than enough people trying to stir things up.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Right.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You brought a letter of recommendation with you?
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Yeah.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You've worked directly for Hyperion?
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Yeah.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Hm...
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	Something wrong?
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	On the contrary.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	It's impressive.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Alright.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I can see why Fero wants you so much.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Eurydice	I'll try not to disappoint him, then.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Don't you worry about that.
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	If half of what it says here is true...
CoExA_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You've already paid for yourself.
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Dorothy?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Dotty!
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Hm?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Áron?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Sorry...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	It's okay.
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Are you alright?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	I guess...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Did they hurt you?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	No...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Not really.
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	But?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	There was this guy, earlier...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	What did he do?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Just a couple of questions about Dad...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	He's done something bad, hasn't he?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Is that why you're here?
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Yeah...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Okay...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Don't worry.
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'm not here to question you.
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	On the contrary...
EnKAD Cell_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'm the one who's got a confession to make.
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	Let's see...
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	I knew it!
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	"9799 2345 7542..." 9799...
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	2345...
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	7542.
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	Alright.
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	Let's put this back...
Galson Alley_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	And see if someone's coming for it.
Galson Alley_Event6_Page2	Ganymede	Right, that confirms it.
Galson Alley_Event6_Page2	Ganymede	Now where's he going with that?
Galson Alley_Event6_Page2	Ganymede	Time to find out!
Galson Alley_Event7_Page2	Ganymede	Nothing here.
Galson Alley_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	Nope.
Galson Alley_Event9_Page2	Ganymede	It's empty.
Filmore Avenue_Event2_Page1	Zuza Bartoš	Oh my!
Filmore Avenue_Event2_Page1	Zuza Bartoš	I've never been to one of those...
Filmore Avenue_Event2_Page2	Zuza Bartoš	They've closed off Rondham...
Filmore Avenue_Event2_Page2	Zuza Bartoš	So, where we going to go now?
Filmore Avenue_Event3_Page1	César Arends	This has been going on for long enough!
Filmore Avenue_Event3_Page1	César Arends	We gotta put a stop to this!
Filmore Avenue_Event3_Page2	César Arends	Anyone seen the Hendricks, lately?
Filmore Avenue_Event5_Page1	Ted Bellerose	Guys, how about the two of you calm down for a minute?
Filmore Avenue_Event5_Page2	Ted Bellerose	I heard they went to Rondham and joined the Militia.
Filmore Avenue_Event6_Page1	Philip Tsvetanov	Hey Drenem.
Filmore Avenue_Event6_Page1	Philip Tsvetanov	Fine day, isn't it?
Filmore Avenue_Event6_Page2	Philip Tsvetanov	Hey.
Filmore Avenue_Event7_Page1	Craig Rivera	That's what I told him, too.
Filmore Avenue_Event7_Page1	Craig Rivera	But he keeps letting his dog run wild on lawn.
Filmore Avenue_Event7_Page2	Craig Rivera	Not since yesterday, no.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I need to speak to Rupert, first.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	This should be it.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	Steady, now.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page3	Female Voice	Coming!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Good day to you!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	To you, as well!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Sorry about the disturbance.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I recently moved into the neighbourhood and wanted to say hi.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, how nice of you!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Too few people do that nowadays.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I know, right?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	It's very important for me to know my neighbours.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I'm Terrence Firaun, by the way.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Or Terry, for short.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Pleased to meet you, Terry!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	I'm Liliane Hendrick.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	But you can call me Lily.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Which house did you move into, if I may ask?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	It's right over there.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	See the one with the stuccoed gable?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	With the green roof?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Exactly!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I've got to say, Trachi has some amazing architecture.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	So I'm very excited to emulate some of the work in my own, once I return to Stratfurt.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, you are an architect?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Aspiring to become one.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	How wonderful!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Then I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay in this neigh-
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	bourhood very much.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	If everyone is as accommodating as you are, I'm sure.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	That's a really nice house you got there, by the way!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, thank you!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Though I'm sometimes a bit embarrassed living in such a mansion right in the heart of the city.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	How long have you been living here?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Around three years.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	My husband insisted on living close to his place of work.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	That would be Mr. Hendrick then?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Precisely!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	I'd love for you to meet him...
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	But he's out on an errand, right now.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Don't worry about it!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I think I've taken up enough of your own time already, anyway.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Not at all!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	I always appreciate getting to know my neighbours a bit better.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, look!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	There he is.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Welcome back, darling!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Come and say hello to our new neighbour.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Pleased to meet you!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I'm Terrence Fusilier.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	And I assume you're Mr. Hendrick?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	That's right.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Now, I'm sorry...
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	But I need to take care of something, urgently.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Oh!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I'm the one who should apologize.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I think I should be going, anyway.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	But it was nice meeting you two!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Don't worry about it.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Say...
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Me and Lily were about to have brunch in a bit.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	And knowing her, she prepared way too much.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Would you mind joining us?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Really?
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	It's been a while since we've had guests...
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	And besides...
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	The Chario won't drink itself.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Unless you want it all for yourself, of course.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, please!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	You're embarassing me!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	But it's a great idea!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Please, be our guest!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	Well...
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Ganymede	I don't know what to say.
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	I'll take it as a yes, then!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	And will see you inside!
Filmore Avenue_Event11_Page7	Ganymede	No point going back in there.
Filmore Avenue_Event15_Page1	Roberto Clarkson	Good morning, Drenem.
Filmore Avenue_Event15_Page1	Roberto Clarkson	Good afternoon!
Filmore Avenue_Event19_Page1	Petros Ochoa	So that's what the shootout was about?
Filmore Avenue_Event24_Page1	Petros Ochoa	East: Gharten Street South: Stuart Alley
Filmore Avenue_Event24_Page1	Sérgio Van der Ven	Oh, don't worry!
Filmore Avenue_Event24_Page1	Sérgio Van der Ven	I know just the perfect restaurant for the two of us.
Filmore Avenue_Event24_Page2	Sérgio Van der Ven	Don't you worry about that, my dear!
Filmore Avenue_Event24_Page2	Sérgio Van der Ven	There's a beautiful cafe, right next to Laurel Bridge.
Filmore Avenue_Event29_Page2	Edgars Pahlke	Don't you think that's a bit harsh?
Filmore Avenue_Event29_Page3	Edgars Pahlke	I wish it was that easy for me.
Filmore Avenue_Event29_Page3	Edgars Pahlke	Siginum is in a pretty rough state, I heard.
Filmore Avenue_Event30_Page1	Nicu Salamon	Anyways, I asked Richard about it.
Filmore Avenue_Event30_Page1	Nicu Salamon	And he told me that there was a jailbreak, yesterday.
Filmore Avenue_Event31_Page1	Rudolf Aarden	Good morning, Mr. Hendrick.
Filmore Avenue_Event31_Page1	Rudolf Aarden	Hope you a nice day, Mr.
Filmore Avenue_Event31_Page2	Rudolf Aarden	Good morning.
Filmore Avenue_Event32_Page2	Timofey McLain	Yeah, that's what I'm saying!
Filmore Avenue_Event32_Page2	Timofey McLain	If they can't afford their rent...
Filmore Avenue_Event32_Page2	Timofey McLain	They have no business living here.
Filmore Avenue_Event32_Page3	Timofey McLain	Agreed.
Filmore Avenue_Event32_Page3	Timofey McLain	First chance I get, I'll go back to Albion, immediately.
Border_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You're not wandering off, are you?
Border_Event4_Page1	Daphne	You're not wandering off, are you?
Border_Event5_Page1	Nikolai Chalupník	You better behave yourselves!
Border_Event6_Page1	Aziz Sokolov	Welcome to Trachi!
Border_Event7_Page1	Alojzij Kováč	Hello, citizen!
Border_Event7_Page1	Alojzij Kováč	Caution is advised for Itonians travelling to Trachi.
Border_Event8_Page1	Andrey Radić	I'm not selling, I'm telling you!
Border_Event10_Page1	Andrey Radić	East: People's Union of Ionia West: Free Republic Trachi South: Faronian Marches
Border_Event10_Page1	Dimos Nikolovski	Good day to you!
Border_Event11_Page1	Zente Tordai	I don't want to go back!
Border_Event11_Page1	Zente Tordai	I want to see Trachi like you promised!
Border_Event12_Page1	Marta Tordai	Don't cry my dear!
Border_Event12_Page1	Marta Tordai	We'll go next year when everything is sorted out.
Border_Event13_Page1	Gábriel Perić	You're sitting on a gold mine here and you want it to simply waste away!?
Border_Event13_Page1	Gábriel Perić	I can't even begin to comprehend stupidity like that!
Border_Event13_Page1	Andrey Radić	You're really starting to test my patience here...
Border_Event19_Page1	Franjo Mihov	Told you I'd get you there in time!
Hendrick Villa_Event1_Page2	Daphne	...
Hendrick Villa_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	...
Hendrick Villa_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Time for me to say goodbye, as well.
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Don't make me wait too long, darling.
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	W-what?
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	W-where am I?
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Oh god...
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Hey!!
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Someone there?!
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Get me out!
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Help me...
Hendrick Villa_Event2_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	PLEASE!!!
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	There you are!
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I was just about to ring you.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Breakfast is almost ready.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It'll have to wait for a bit, I'm afraid.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Oh?
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Something wrong?
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	No.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I just need to take care of something, first.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Can't you do it afterwards?
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Unfortunately not.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm sorry.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	It's fine.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	But I'd like to know where you're going, at least.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	If you insist.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I got a call from Mrs. Barkley, a few minutes ago.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You remember that Chario we had in Lombourgh, last year?
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	How could I ever forget!
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Apparently, she's gotten hold of a bottle.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Really?!
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Yeah.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll go and pick it up from her stall in Clarin.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	So if you don't mind...
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	We could make our breakfast a brunch.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Just like back then.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	That sounds amazing!
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'll get to work on it, immediately.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Just don't get any ideas about opening that bottle without me!
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I would never.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's for a special occasion, after all.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll be right back.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Okay.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'll see you in a bit.
Hendrick Villa_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I can't be seen running through their house too much.
Hendrick Villa_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	I can't leave just yet.
Hendrick Villa_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	I should say goodbye, first.
Hendrick Villa_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	I can't leave just yet.
Hendrick Villa_Event5_Page3	Ganymede	I should say goodbye, first.
Hendrick Villa_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Onions, garlic and potatoes it was.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	Let's see...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	There's tomatoes, carrots and radishes.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	That leaves...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	Onions, garlic and potatoes.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	Would you mind getting those from the pantry?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Ganymede	Sure!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page2	Ganymede	I'll be right back!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	The pantry is right over there.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	How's it going with the onions?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	Done!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Very good!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	Say...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	Would you mind if I open a window?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	My eyes have gotten a bit runny.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Feel free to!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	Anything else I can do?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Mhh, I don't think so.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	We're about done, anyway.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Just need to let it simmer for a bit.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	Alright!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	I'll do the washing up.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Feel free to rest up a bit.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	You sure you don't want any help with that?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Absolutely!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	You already did more than enough.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	Okay.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page4	Ganymede	I'll make myself comfortable, then.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page5	Liliane Hendrick	I'll be right there.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Brunch should be ready in a minute.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Yeah, about that...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	I'm terribly sorry, but I just remembered that I urgently need to be somewhere.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Really?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Yeah...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Wish it could wait, but there's nothing I can do, I'm afraid.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	That's a shame.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	I feel very embarrassed putting you to work like that and not even giving something in return.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	How about you take some of that stew with you?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	I could never accept that.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Please, I insist!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Okay...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	But only a tiny bit.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	There you go.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Hold on!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	This is way too much!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Not at all!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	We prepared lunch for four people, after all!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Come again?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	I think Drenem was discussing a few things with someone, upstairs.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Is that so?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	You didn't hear it?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Can't say I did.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	What were they talking about?
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	I don't know.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	I tried not to listen too attentively, since it's none of my business.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Though Drenem sounded like he got quite worked up.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	He really should take it easy, sometimes.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	In any case, I think I heard her leave, just now.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	So I guess it's up to you to take her share.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Alright, if you insist.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Thank you very much!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	I'll stop by again, sometime soon.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Please do!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	You're always welcome!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	And thank you for helping me out, as well.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Don't mention it!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Please give my best regards to Mr. Hendrick as well.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Once I'm properly accommodated...
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	I'll make sure to invite the two of you over!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	I'm looking forward to it!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	Hope you have a splendid day.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Liliane Hendrick	And please let me know how the stew was.
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page6	Ganymede	Will do!
Hendrick Villa_Event7_Page7	Liliane	Hope you have a nice afternoon, Terry!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Wow...
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	It's so spacious!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Apologies if it's not looking as fine as it should.
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	But as you can see, there's a lot of room to clean.
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	And since we don't have a maid anymore...
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	It's a real struggle to keep all of it in good shape.
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Don't worry about it!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	It looks great!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Thank you!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'm going to head into the kitchen and prepare a stew.
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Mind if I help you out?
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Are you sure?
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'm not too fond of putting guests to work.
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	It's no problem at all!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	I'd be more than happy to repay the hospitality!
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Well, if you insist...
Hendrick Villa_Event8_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	The kitchen is right over there.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Gretchen Faber	Absolutely!
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Gretchen Faber	You've really outdone yourself this time, Lily.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Not at all!
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	All the credit should go to you, Gretchen.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	You're too modest.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	Thank you for having us, again.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	I'm glad you could make it.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	On such a short notice, especially!
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	It's the least I can do.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	I always make time for old friends such as you two.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	Besides, Drenem and me have something to discuss, anyway.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	Would you mind if I borrowed him for a bit, Lily?
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	Go right ahead!
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Liliane Hendrick	As long as you give him back, that is.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Laurits Faber	He'll be returned just the way you found him, no question.
Hendrick Villa_Event9_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	Let's talk in my study, then.
Hendrick Villa_Event18_Page2	Gretchen Faber	Thank you so much for having us.
Hendrick Villa_Event21_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	Don't worry about the dishes, darling.
Hendrick Villa_Event21_Page2	Liliane Hendrick	We'll take care of them.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	I'm sorry Gretchen, but we're in the middle of a discussion right now.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	Sorry to interrupt you two.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	But I wanted to see if Clara was here.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	Wasn't she with you?
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	Yes.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	She was playing with Humphrey in the living room just a few minutes ago.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	Me and Lily went to do the dishes in the kitchen...
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	But when we came back, she was gone.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	We already checked all the rooms, safe for this one.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	Well, she must be in here somewhere.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	What if she went out the front door?
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	There's no way she could've opened that by herself.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	Keep looking, I'll be right there.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	Just give me a few minutes.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	Alright.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	But please don't take too long.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Gretchen Faber	I'll make a second sweep through the house.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	Make sure to check every nook and cranny.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page2	Laurits Faber	You know how much she likes to hide.
Drenem Study_Event2_Page3	Laurits Faber	In any case...
Drenem Study_Event2_Page3	Laurits Faber	Can I count on your support, then?
Drenem Study_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Of course.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I'm glad we're able to see eye to eye on this.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	To be fair...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	It's not like I have much of a choice, do I?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	There's always a choice.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	And I'm sure a man like you is clever enough to figure out which path to take.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Whatever you say.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	But I'd like to keep Lily out of this, if possible.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Of course!
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Very sorry about the intrusion.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	But we need to make sure this place is prepared.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	For all of our sakes.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	The mere the idea of something like that happening in my house...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I can understand that.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Which is why it's important that there's no hiccups.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I can trust you to uphold your side of the deal, as well?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Naturally!
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	She'll be taken care of.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	You have to understand, however...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	That custom's won't let anyone through, until we're done.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Just get her out before anything bad happens.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Don't worry.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	She'll be well protected.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Did you tell her?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I don't think there's any need to.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I'm not so sure, unfortunately.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Why?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Asking Faber for a meeting might look suspicious.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	So?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	What are you proposing?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Your wife...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	She used to be close friends with Mrs.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Faber, right?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Some time ago, yes.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	We need you to reactivate that bond...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Make it look like the entire thing was her idea.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	You are out of your mind.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	This will put her right in the line of fire!
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I don't think so.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Unless word about her family gets out, of course.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Alright, alright.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I get it.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I know it's a hard sell.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Then again...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I'm sure that both Mrs. Faber and Liliane would love the idea.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	And Laurits?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	He's stubborn, from what I heard.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	But if you give him something he desperately wants...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	He'll bite, I'm sure!
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	There's a motion tabled in Parliament, no?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	You want me to support him?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	If that's what it takes...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Do it.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Alright.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Anything else?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Just give us a sign once you've brought him up here.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	We'll take care of the rest.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	And what's that going to be?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Are you sure you want to know?
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	...
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Drenem Study_Event3_Page2	Daphne	That's what I thought.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Glad to see age hasn't diminished your skills, at all.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	I like to believe that it's more about the feeling than anything else.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	And I'm still the same man as back then.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I never doubted that.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	I'm not so sure.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	In any case, though...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	You wanted to discuss something.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Right.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I've come to the decision that it's best if I support your motion in Parliament.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	Not to sound too ungrateful...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	But why the change of mind?
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I can't say I agree with what you're planning...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	But we can't afford partisanship, anymore.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	I'm glad you see it that way, too.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	The city's under siege.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	Just today, we arrested a young lad who had killed a member of the Guard.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I heard about it.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Have you identified him?
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	Not yet.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	I have someone questioning him, though.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	But so far, he refused to even state his name.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	No credentials?
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	Unfortunately not.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Hm...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Doesn't sound like a crime of passion to me.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	Indeed.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	The assumption is that he's either an insurgent...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	Or a foreign operative.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	But right now, your guess is as good as mine.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Have you talked with the other administrators?
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	No.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	I hate to say it...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	But I'm not sure who's on our side, anymore.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Hmm...
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	You're gonna go through with the celebration, tomorrow?
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	There is no other choice.
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Laurits Faber	We musn't be intimidated!
Drenem Study_Event5_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Yes?
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Hendrick speaking.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Oh?
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	No, I haven't heard of that, yet.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Are you sure?
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's too risky.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	With so many people about, there's a real chance of this going south.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Yes...
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I know.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Okay then.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll see what I can do.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Alright.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Time to wrap it up.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Sorry, Icarus.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Daphne	For everything.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Goodbye.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Rupert?
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Yeah, it's me.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Mhm.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	It's the reason I'm calling you, actually.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I'll give you the details in person, if you don't mind.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Right.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	No, don't worry.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Let's meet at your office in Hudsman.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Yeah.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I'll be there in fifteen.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	Okay.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	See you then.
Drenem Study_Event6_Page4	Drenem Hendrick	It's time.
Old Admirality (N)_Event5_Page1	Ivan Donne	Hope you have a good day, sir.
Old Admirality (N)_Event5_Page3	Ivan Donne	Hope you have a good day, sir.
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	Are you serious?
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	I can't just wait "a few days"!
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	There's a market of people eager to buy over there, AND the biggest festival of the year coming up!
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	I got some A-class souvenirs and if people can't take it with them when they go home...
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	I'm not one to say, but you might have a riot on your hands.
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	City Guard	Now... I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	City Guard	Please check in with the custom's office if you have any complaints.
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	FINE!
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page1	Darius Swango	Don't say I didn't warn you!
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page2	Darius Swango	Bunch of imbeciles, all of them...
Old Admirality (N)_Event9_Page4	Diogo Mayer	I'm moving up the ranks, baby!
Old Admirality (N)_Event10_Page1	Jelka Darby	Please stay calm.
Old Admirality (N)_Event10_Page2	Lenart Marjanović	Hm, I wonder if Svetlana likes this kind of stuff...
Old Admirality (N)_Event15_Page1	Servant	Are you okay, my lady?
Old Admirality (N)_Event15_Page1	Elegant Woman	I'm alright.
Old Admirality (N)_Event15_Page1	Elegant Woman	Just a bit dizzy from the trip.
Old Admirality (N)_Event15_Page1	Elegant Woman	Let's get the custom's procedure over with.
Old Admirality (N)_Event15_Page1	Servant	Right away, my lady.
Old Admirality (N)_Event16_Page1	Servant	Good day, sir.
Old Admirality (N)_Event17_Page1	Kristina Remington	Oh, come on!
Old Admirality (N)_Event17_Page1	Kristina Remington	Just one quick stroll...
Old Admirality (N)_Event17_Page2	Kristina Remington	We don't have to buy anything, you know?
Old Admirality (N)_Event18_Page1	Zétény Fekete	We have the situation under control.
Old Admirality (N)_Event19_Page1	Valentin Van Niftrik	I'm sorry, sir!
Old Admirality (N)_Event19_Page1	Valentin Van Niftrik	It was all there when we were on the ship, I swear!
Old Admirality (N)_Event19_Page3	Valentin Van Niftrik	Feels good to be my own boss, now.
Old Admirality (N)_Event23_Page1	Ganymede	Still nothing...
Old Admirality (N)_Event23_Page1	Ganymede	Might as well call it here.
Old Admirality (N)_Event23_Page1	Ganymede	Not much chance of-
Old Admirality (N)_Event23_Page1	Ganymede	What the fuck?
Old Admirality (N)_Event23_Page1	Ganymede	Guess like I'm not the only one who heard it.
Old Admirality (N)_Event23_Page1	Ganymede	Let's head back.
Old Admirality (N)_Event25_Page1	Ainsley Gouveia	And you're telling me that entire crate of Chario just vanished, hm?
Old Admirality (N)_Event25_Page2	Ainsley Gouveia	I've had it with your excuses!
Old Admirality (N)_Event26_Page1	Flore Triggs	Move along, please.
Old Admirality (N)_Event27_Page3	Martin Genkov	See?
Old Admirality (N)_Event27_Page3	Martin Genkov	I always knew we could come to an agreement.
Old Admirality (N)_Event28_Page1	Lazar Regenbogen	Listen up you little upstart...
Old Admirality (N)_Event28_Page1	Lazar Regenbogen	I was here first.
Old Admirality (N)_Event28_Page1	Lazar Regenbogen	So you better get off my jetty right now, or I'll have all of your shit thrown into the sea!
Old Admirality (N)_Event28_Page3	Lazar Regenbogen	As long as you keep your word.
Old Admirality (N)_Event29_Page1	Laura Ecclestone	You still owe me from last time, remember?
Old Admirality (N)_Event30_Page1	Mojmír Bautista	Make sure to keep your eyes on your luggage!
Old Admirality (N)_Event30_Page2	Mojmír Bautista	No need to panic!
Old Admirality (N)_Event32_Page1	Bernadine Smits	Hmm...
Old Admirality (N)_Event32_Page2	Bernadine Smits	Mhh...
Old Admirality (N)_Event32_Page3	Bernadine Smits	Huh...
Old Admirality (N)_Event32_Page4	Bernadine Smits	I see...
Old Admirality (N)_Event32_Page5	Bernadine Smits	Seriously....
Old Admirality (N)_Event32_Page5	Bernadine Smits	You got nothing better do?
Old Admirality (N)_Event33_Page1	Diogo Mayer	Did you hear that, too?
Old Admirality (N)_Event34_Page1	Servant	Good day, sir.
Old Admirality (N)_Event35_Page1	Pavle Holub	Apologies, but could you use the other door?
Old Admirality (N)_Event39_Page1	Pavle Holub	Note to all non-citizens: Starting August the 24th, every foreigner must carry their visum with them at all times.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page2	Pavle Holub	North: Clarin Square West: Pike Bridge
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page2	Louis Tanner	This is Lieutenant Tanner of the Republican Guard.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page2	Louis Tanner	You are harbouring enemies of the state on your premises.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page2	Louis Tanner	We have you surrounded.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	No offense...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	But you lot mind keeping it down?
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	There's people trying to sleep here.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Julius...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	So that's where you've been hiding.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Throwing your lot in with terrorists, now?
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	The only terrorists here are you and your bunch of thugs.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	So how about you send them home, hm?
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	And the two of us talk like grown-ups.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	If you're able to, that is.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	I can see this is pointless.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	This is your last warning!
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Open the door.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Or we'll force our way inside.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	Well...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	If you insist.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	Told you.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	You'd really go this far...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Just to get back at me?
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	You bloody idiot...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	This isn't about you.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	Someone's gotta protect this city.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	And seeing as you're completely incapable...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Julius Gaston	We just gotta do it, ourselves.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	If that makes you sleep at night.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Be my guest.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	But I won't stand by while there's insurgents running rampant.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	So if it's war, you want...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	You shall have it.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Ready weapons, men!
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	HOLD!
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	Heinrich?
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Louis.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	What the hell are you doing here?
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	You said it yourself.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Men like us...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Can't just stand idly by.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Lower your weapons, everyone.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	There won't be any bloodshed, today.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Louis Tanner	You have no jurisdiction here.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Right.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	And frankly, the uniform doesn't fit me, anymore.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	But I'm not here as a Lieutenant.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	No...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Right now, I'm just a messenger.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Two hours ago...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	One of my dearest friends committed suicide.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	But before he ended his life...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	He wrote a letter for me to distribute.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	It's his confession...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	And his testament.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	So hear me, everyone!
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	And listen, as my friend and compatriot...
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Arnold Francesco Solka.
Old Admirality (N)_Event89_Page3	Heinrich Navrátil	Takes a leap of faith for you.
Old Admirality (N)_Event93_Page1	Daniel Hornick	We're here to stay.
Old Admirality (N)_Event94_Page1	Patrik Kovačić	Another day, another revolution.
Old Admirality (N)_Event96_Page1	Bohdan Zupančič	Hang the oppressor!
Old Admirality (N)_Event96_Page1	Bohdan Zupančič	Hang 'em high!
Old Admirality (N)_Event97_Page1	Črt Ilić	Fuck Faber. Fuck the Guardies. Fuck Amryn.
Old Admirality (N)_Event97_Page1	Črt Ilić	Fuck everyone who's not on our side.
Office_Event1_Page1	Unknown	Come in.
Office_Event2_Page1	Sergej Pavlović	And I'm telling you that's bullshit!
Office_Event2_Page1	Sergej Pavlović	If we don't meet our quotas this month, we'll have to lay off at least ten percent of our staff.
Office_Event3_Page1	Ljuban Zorić	Hello, Mr. Hendrick.
Office_Event4_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's locked.
Office_Event5_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's locked.
Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's locked.
Office_Event7_Page1	Radmilo Novak	There's no way Parliament will let us go under.
Office_Event7_Page1	Radmilo Novak	We're too big to fail.
Office_Event9_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's locked.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Jesus...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Were you trying to give me a heart attack?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Awww...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Are you that happy to see me?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	What the hell are you doing here?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Come on, now!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	That's no way to treat an old friend!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	I'm not gonna repeat myself.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Relax, for god's sake!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You know, Icarus...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I think the two of us need to have a conversation.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	About what?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	There's a boy with us.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And I want to understand him better.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Cool.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Good luck with that.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Icarus...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Why do we always have to play this stupid game?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I know about the two of you...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You told me, remember?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	That business with General Forten, two years ago...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And how much fun the two of you had.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	God, I wish I could have been part of that!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	So that's what it's all about?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	You're still pissed?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Jesus.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Listen, Icarus...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I don't care who or what you're screwing.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	What I do care about...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Is that this operation doesn't get fucked because one of our agents is playing boy scout.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I know it's what he does.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Acting like that.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And I gotta hand it to him...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	He's very, very good at it.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	But there's a question on my mind.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	If we're on the same side...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Why is he pulling that shit on us?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Tell me, Icarus.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Listen, Daph...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	I know you're very invested in your job.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	But you've got to realize...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	That we're all just trying to get by.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You're absolutely right.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Which is why I need you to tell me.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	I'm getting tired of this.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	I'll go take a shower.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Make yourself comfortable...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	If you haven't, already.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Come on.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Don't move.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	There's really no need for that.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Shut up!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	This isn't funny, you know.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Jesus!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Icarus	Are you insane?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I won't miss again.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Face the wall to your right.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page1	Daphne	On your knees.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page2	Icarus	You really have no boundaries, do you?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Hands behind your back.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	Is this your new kink?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	Because I really don't know what kind of statement you're trying to make.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Much better.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	What's that?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I'm sorry...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But I can't hear you like that.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	In any case...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I'm afraid I don't have the time to play cat and mouse with you.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	So the next time you open your mouth...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You better say something productive.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Ganymede.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Trojan boy.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Why is he here?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	I don't know.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But you have theories.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	Alright, alright!
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	I get it.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	There was a message from Fero.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	That Gany was on his way.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	What else?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	I'm supposed to keep an eye on him.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	Just in case.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Go on.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	That's all there is to it.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	What the fuck was that for?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You're not telling the truth.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Fero must've given you a reason, at least.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	A reason for what?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Not choosing you, instead.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	For arteria?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Yeah.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	I don't think I was ever considered.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You were among the top four.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Fero never told you about it?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	No.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	That didn't surprise you?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	I honestly don't care what kind of politics they're playing, up there.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	As long as it brings the city home.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Well, if it's like that...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You'll have to make a choice.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Because not everyone's on our side.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	All I can say...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	Is that Gany's exceptional at his job.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	He's putting up a show, for sure...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	But he's doesn't stab his own people in the back.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	Or cuff them for no fucking reason.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Right.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I think that's enough of an introduction, anyway.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	What do you mean?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Sorry...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But you're on the list.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Icarus	You can't be serious.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	It's decided.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	No reason to hold back, anymore.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	For both of us.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Almost twelve.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Six hours, give or take.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Until then, I need you to tell me everything you know about Ganymede.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Everything the two of you did together.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	And everything that this son of a bitch Fero is planning.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Consider it your last confession.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Hm, I see...
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You just can't wait to get underway, can you?
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Alright.
Icarus Apartment_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Brace yourself.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	I'm sorry, Niky.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Really.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	You were one of a kind.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Brave, and always eager.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	You turned a chicken house into a palace for me.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	I wanted to return that favour.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	But there you are.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Taken the bullet intended for me.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Rest easy, my sun and stars.
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Because I'll put a stop to this, I swear!
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	And more importantly...
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	Make sure that bitch will pay for it!
Icarus Apartment_Event6_Page2	Ganymede	I'll see you on the other side...
Icarus Apartment_Event7_Page1	Ganymede	I'll see you on the other side...
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	Hey Niky.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Yo.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	Did you talk to Solka?
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Yeah.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	What did he say?
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	He doesn't believe it's true.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	And the letter from Gregor?
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Said it's probably just another bluff.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	I wish.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Me too.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	In any case, we got to do something.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	Right.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	I could ask Drenem if he knows anything.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	I'm not sure if he can be trusted with that kind of stuff.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	At least, not yet.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	Right.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	But I don't think we have another choice.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	I wanna try something, first.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	Okay?
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Someone from EnKAD leaked that stuff to us, right?
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Maybe they're just trying to poke us.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	So let's fight smoke with smoke.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	We send out a message...
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	That Solka has proven uncooperative.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Since time is short, and for humanitarian reasons...
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	We'll go to the authorities.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	Niky...
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Alexandra Trajkovski	That's treason.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	I'm not gonna do any such thing, of course.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	But it'll rattle them good, I'm sure.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	And since I'm from Trachi, no one's going to question it.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	Except for Gregor.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	As for EnKAD...
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	I know someone there.
Icarus Apartment_Event8_Page1	Nikolas Goran	And I think it's just about time I put her to use.
Heria Apartments_Event1_Page1	Valentin Kovač	Hey there.
First Floor_Event3_Page2	Unknown	*Locked*
First Floor_Event3_Page2	Frederick Harrington	Sorry, sir.
First Floor_Event3_Page2	Frederick Harrington	But the upper levels are off-limits, for now.
Second Floor_Event1_Page2	Unknown	*Locked*
Second Floor_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I should go back to the Safehouse and change, first.
Second Floor_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Hm?
Second Floor_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I don't want to go up there, again.
Record Keeper Home_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Marks all over his neck.
Record Keeper Home_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Poor guy.
Record Keeper Home_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Record Keeper Home_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	No time to waste.
Record Keeper Home_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	I need to get some info first.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Fuck.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I should go.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	On the other hand...
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	This might be the last shot I get.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Stay calm.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Hmm...
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	This looks promising.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	They were looking into us...
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Very little details, though.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Hm?
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Wait...
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	No way!
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	You fucking piece of shit!
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Sir?
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	...
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Open the door, please.
Record Keeper Home_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	We know you're in there.
Record Keeper Home_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	No time to waste.
Record Keeper Home_Event7_Page1	Ganymede	"Autonomy - How Trachi reclaimed itself" "Trachi - A history of freedom" Wow.
Record Keeper Home_Event7_Page1	Ganymede	Totally not full of themselves, aren't they?
Record Keeper Home_Event7_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event7_Page2	Ganymede	Let's see how long they can keep their freedom.
Record Keeper Home_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Uh...
Record Keeper Home_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	Let's not talk about that.
Record Keeper Home_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	Nope!
Record Keeper Home_Event9_Page1	Ganymede	Just a couple of books about the region.
Record Keeper Home_Event9_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event9_Page2	Ganymede	Just a couple of books about the region.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	Hm.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	A codebook.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	Shit.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	What were the numbers again?
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	"9799 2345" something something.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	That makes...
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	"Triumvirate entrance"-
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	"Acknowledged"?
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	That one checks out, at least.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event10_Page2	Ganymede	Guess he wasn't bullshitting me, after all.
Record Keeper Home_Event11_Page1	Ganymede	"The rise and fall of Graikós".
Record Keeper Home_Event11_Page1	Ganymede	Good riddance, I guess.
Record Keeper Home_Event11_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event11_Page2	Ganymede	Ionia sounds much better, anyway.
Record Keeper Home_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	Notes on the IIS.
Record Keeper Home_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	Jesus...
Record Keeper Home_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	You really put your back into this, didn't you?
Record Keeper Home_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event12_Page2	Ganymede	I hope you're right, Greg.
Record Keeper Home_Event13_Page1	Ganymede	"The second Ionian enlightenment".
Record Keeper Home_Event13_Page1	Ganymede	"On the Thalassian War - How control over a channel changed the face of Europa".
Record Keeper Home_Event13_Page1	Ganymede	Hmm...
Record Keeper Home_Event13_Page1	Ganymede	It's all pointing at us.
Record Keeper Home_Event13_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event13_Page2	Ganymede	Almost like someone put this here, deliberately.
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page1	Ganymede	Construction plans?
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page1	Ganymede	Wait a second.
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page1	Ganymede	This is...
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page1	Ganymede	Fredrick Dam?
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page2	Ganymede	Man...
Record Keeper Home_Event14_Page2	Ganymede	This is even bigger than I thought.
Record Keeper Home_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	Wait...
Record Keeper Home_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	Those are about Nestville.
Record Keeper Home_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	They knew we were going there.
Record Keeper Home_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	Damn...
Record Keeper Home_Event15_Page1	Ganymede	I need to close the door.
Record Keeper Home_Event15_Page2	Ganymede	I guess that explains why we went there, in the first place.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Oh boy.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Long time no see.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Yup.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Go ahead.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Ask away.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I doubt there's any point in that, really.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Skipping straight to the violent part?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Unless there's something you want to share with me?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Not really.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I mean...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	You could just let me go.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Nice try.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	But you're in no position to demand anything.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Found towering over a dead body.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	An official of the state, no less.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Very, very bad business.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Right.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	And I gotta say...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	That was a really nice setup!
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Couldn't have done it better, myself!
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	You killed that man.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	And not only that...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	You also disguised yourself as a member of the Guard.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	That's right.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	I know you were sniffing around.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Even met with the Colonel.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	So I wonder...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	What's it you're after?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Trying to dig up some dirt on me, hm?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Why so quiet all of a sudden?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Hm?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Oh...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Sorry!
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I think I fell asleep for a second, there.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Would you mind repeating what you said?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Hm.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	This...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Will be interesting.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	What were you doing in that apartment?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page2	Louis Tanner	Answer me!
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	I gotta admit.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	You're tougher than I thought.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Hm.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	Not at all.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Haven't heard a worse lie throughout my entire life.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	I'd rather you just give me answers, instead.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	There's nothing for me to tell you.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	And let's face it.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	You're not looking for answers, anyway.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	Whatever you say.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	But since you're still not talking...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page3	Louis Tanner	I'm forced to use more drastic measures.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	There you are again.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Can't have you spacing out like that.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	It's a nice trick, though, I gotta admit.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Sorry...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I know you're giving it your best.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	It's kind of adorable, in its own way.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	But if you want this to work...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	You really need to step up your game.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Big words.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	But you can't keep this up, forever.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Whereas I...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Have all the time in the world.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Are you serious?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	No.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Really?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	That's bad.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Alright.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	It's a pity.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	But understandable.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Agreed.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	I'll be there in a minute.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Looks like you got lucky.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	You're free to go.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Really?
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Ya.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Circumstances have changed.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I see.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	Bit of a shame, to be honest...
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Ganymede	I was just starting to get into it.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	Whatever you say.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	You can grab your things at the reception.
Cell (Trachi)_Event1_Page4	Louis Tanner	'Till next time.
Cell (Trachi)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Well...
Cell (Trachi)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	That was something.
Cell (Trachi)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Time to head back.
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Anastasija Stojanov	Timo?
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I'm out here, mum.
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Anastasija Stojanov	Do you want to come in?
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Anastasija Stojanov	Dinner is ready.
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I'll be there in a second.
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Let's go inside, Anton.
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hey!
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Don't get too jumpy!
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Stop it!
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hahaha!
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Careful with your paws!
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Anton, please!
Backyard_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	You're hurting me!
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Drenem.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Everything alright?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Sort of.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Thanks for seeing me, in any case.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll try not to take up too much of your time.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Don't sweat it!
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Want to take a seat?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm good, thank you.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	So... what can I do for you?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm in a bit of a bind, to be honest.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Is this about what happened at the checkpoint, yesterday?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll raise the issue in parliament, later.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But that's not what's causing me trouble, right now.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I got a phone call, a few hours ago.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Who was it?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	They didn't say.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Just to pick something up.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	This bottle of Laronde, right here.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Drenem...
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Why would you go along with something like that?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Did you know Lily was originally from Ionia?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	What does that have to do with it?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	She has relatives there.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	One of them being a former operative of the IIS.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	If I don't comply...
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm finished.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	And Lily will hate herself, forever.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Did you talk to her about it?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	There's no way I could break it to her.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	So, what are you going to do?
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm supposed to put this into a mailbox in Trenton, this afternoon.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I can't bring this home with me.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You know how Lily is.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	Alright.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	I'll hold onto it, for you.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	But I'm going to take a look into this matter.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	And try to find out who's behind it.
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	From now on...
Starling Office_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	We're in this together.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Citizens of Trachi!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Brothers and sisters.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Today is meant to be a joyous day.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	I remember it, as it were yesterday.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	How we, with nothing but our own steady hands, claimed freedom for ourselves.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Three years later, we find ourselves on the precipice, once more.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Two days ago, a criminal was freed from his confinements.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	And yesterday, a valued member of the Guard was murdered in his own apartment.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	As if that weren't enough...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	My own daughter was torn from me.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	I refused to let foreign forces run rampant through this city.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	And little Clara...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Paid the price.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	So what does a man do when he finds himself the target of extortion?
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	When even his own family isn't safe, anymore.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	I ask you, brave people of Trachi...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	What am I to do?
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	RESIGN!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	What was that?
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Julius Gaston	I don't think he heard you, lads.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Julius Gaston	Right boys, one more time.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Julius Gaston	Three. Two. One.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Julius Gaston	RESIGN!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	What's the meaning of this?
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Julius Gaston	You still don't get it?
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Julius Gaston	You're being couped.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Sorry Laurits.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Rupert Sternlein	But you had it coming.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	I don't know what kind of wicked game you're playing...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	But I won't have you trample on the constitution of this city!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Men!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Louis Tanner	Sorry, friend.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Louis Tanner	We've had a good run.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Louis Tanner	But I think it's time to call it quits.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Louis Tanner	At least I will.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	Louis...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Laurits Faber	How dare you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Laurits Faber!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Out of my way, Guardsman.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	"If the elected leader of Trachi is found to be collaborating with foreign forces...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	It is the people's duty to restore Autonomy to Trachi.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	By force, if necessary." This... is what the constitution says.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Laurits Faber.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	You are charged with treason, terrorism and several instances of corruption.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	For this, you will stand trial.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	And until that day comes...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	You are under arrest.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Citizens of Trachi!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits	Today is meant to be a joyous day.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As in the years before, we are to rest upon what we have achieved.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	To commemamorate the fruits of our labour...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And gaze with prideful eyes on a city that we – with our hands – have built.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	All of you have worked day for day since then – always in pursuit of greater heights.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	We've shown the world, without a shadow of a doubt...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Trachians are menat to strive!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	I remember the day, as clear as if it were yesterday...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Three years ago, this proud city fought to reclaim it's land.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	They said we couldn't do it.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Too deep sat the distrust in our own abilities...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	That even some among us wouldn't dare to dream.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	But those that doubted...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	We proved wrong.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And those who had sold themselves into servitude and conspired with our enemies...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	We cast out.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And against all odds, we held strong.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	We persevered.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Against a foe that had a thousand times our numbers, we fought and achieved the most valuable thing in the world: Freedom.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	There is no Trachi without Trachians.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And there are no Trachians who serve as a slave for someone else.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	On this day, where we look back and remember those that fell during that struggle...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	We must again, rise from our slumber...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And with refound vigilance...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Strike at those who prey upon our liberty!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Just yesterday, a man was murdered in his own apartment.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	An esteemed member of the Republican Guard.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	My thoughts are with the family he left behind.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And his colleagues and friends who bemourn this tragic incident...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Yearn for justice.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	I, myself, have also suffered a terrible loss just a few hours ago.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Last night, my very own daughter was found dead.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	A heinous, surgically planned assassination.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Farnswood	...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As a father, my grief is beyond anything that words could express.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	But as your Mayor, I am appalled that I let this happen in this city.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	My daughter...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	She died because I refused to bend to foreign powers.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Yesterday morning, an Ionian official burst into this very city hall...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	He demanded me to open the gates and for Trachi and to become Ionia's satellite.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	I refused.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And little Clara...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	She paid the price for my disobedience.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As such, beyond the sadness I carry...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	I am ever more sure in one thing: We won't be intimidated!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	But I cannot speak for all of us.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	For some people, personal friends of mine among them...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Were scheming behind our back.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And as soon as they smelled their chance...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Leapt to the opportunity and rebelled.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As I speak, parts of the city are under siege.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As I'm speaking, valiant heroes of the Guard are breaching into Trenton Plaza to repel the insurgents.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Our Rondham has been torn from us.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	But I promise you this....
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Tonight, we'll have it back.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	In the meantime, I ask all of you...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Lend this city your support in whichever way you can.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Every able-bodied man is welcome to enlist in our fight for this city's sake.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	For it is time...
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	To stand with me and purge those that bully their way into supremacy!
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As of today, we are at war.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As such, the city council has decided, with immediate effect: That all borders be sealed temporarily.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	A curfew ranging from dusk till dawn will be introduced.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And gatherings between more than 6 people will also be prohibited.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	As much as it pains me, the carnival will also have to be adjourned.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	I am deeply sorry to take this day away from you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	But we cannot risk an incident where the lives of people are at stake.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	So please, if possible.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Return to your homes immediately.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	If you have seen or heard anything relating to the incidents of the last day, please report them to the Guard immediately.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	And if you know of someone affiliated with Ionia, do not hesitate to point them out.
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	Together, we will weather this storm, as well..
Anderson Park (N)_Event6_Page2	Laurits Faber	I thank you all for your cooperation.
Anderson Park (N)_Event56_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event57_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event58_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event60_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event61_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event63_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park (N)_Event65_Page1	Kai Knepp	Top of the day to you.
Anderson Park_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event2_Page1	Iuliu Pavlov	Fruits, snacks, everything else you need to get you through a busy day of sight-seeing!
Anderson Park_Event2_Page3	Iuliu Pavlov	Stock up now, or regret it later.
Anderson Park_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event6_Page1	Frankie Norling	Wait, you too?
Anderson Park_Event6_Page1	Frankie Norling	They told me it's about restructuring.
Anderson Park_Event6_Page1	Frankie Norling	But that's bollocks.
Anderson Park_Event6_Page3	Frankie Norling	Right.
Anderson Park_Event6_Page3	Frankie Norling	The only reason why I signed up in the first place was because of the Colonel and the others.
Anderson Park_Event9_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event12_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event14_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	???	Are you sure about this?
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	Yes.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	It's all set up.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	But I need one of your men to cover me.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	Just in case.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	???	Alright.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	???	You've got the address?
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	There you go.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	???	How much time do you need?
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	The entire night, if possible.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	???	Poor guy.
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	???	Isn't he one of your people?
Anderson Park_Event16_Page2	Daphne	That's what I'm trying to find out.
Anderson Park_Event17_Page1	Colin Rennold	Looks like a storm's coming this way.
Anderson Park_Event17_Page2	Maverick	Can you see those clouds, too?
Anderson Park_Event17_Page4	Colin Rennold	I'll stay right here, no matter what happens.
Anderson Park_Event18_Page1	Neil Kristoffersen	I wonder...
Anderson Park_Event18_Page1	Neil Kristoffersen	Pork or beef?
Anderson Park_Event18_Page3	Neil Kristoffersen	I wonder...
Anderson Park_Event18_Page3	Neil Kristoffersen	Us or them?
Anderson Park_Event19_Page1	Finlay Richelieu	Could be because you stick out like a christmas tree!
Anderson Park_Event19_Page3	Finlay Richelieu	Can't believe they'd actually try to stage a coup, like that.
Anderson Park_Event20_Page1	Eliav Nepi	I'm not so sure about that.
Anderson Park_Event20_Page1	Eliav Nepi	Everytime I'm in Rondham, it feels like I'm being watched.
Anderson Park_Event20_Page3	Eliav Nepi	See?
Anderson Park_Event20_Page3	Eliav Nepi	I told you there'd be trouble!
Anderson Park_Event21_Page1	Lara Dragov	Did you see that the Eccelstone's bought themselves one of the new car-things?
Anderson Park_Event21_Page1	Lara Dragov	I saw them drive by, last weekend.
Anderson Park_Event23_Page1	Sofia Paterson	Oh, I saw them too!
Anderson Park_Event23_Page1	Sofia Paterson	It broke down in the middle of the street, yesterday.
Anderson Park_Event23_Page1	Sofia Paterson	You should have seen them!
Anderson Park_Event23_Page2	Sofia Paterson	You should have seen them!
Anderson Park_Event23_Page2	Sofia Paterson	They were furious!
Anderson Park_Event24_Page1	Brunello Boyce	Seriously?
Anderson Park_Event24_Page1	Brunello Boyce	What the hell is going on?
Anderson Park_Event24_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event24_Page3	Brunello Boyce	I'm getting really anxious about all this.
Anderson Park_Event25_Page1	Wil Castell	That's ridiculous!
Anderson Park_Event25_Page1	Wil Castell	Aren't we like, citizen of this city?
Anderson Park_Event25_Page3	Wil Castell	Me too.
Anderson Park_Event25_Page3	Wil Castell	The city's really changed, hasn't it?
Anderson Park_Event26_Page1	Ingrid Shirley	They even asked grandma for her credentials.
Anderson Park_Event26_Page1	Ingrid Shirley	Can you believe that?!
Anderson Park_Event26_Page3	Ingrid Shirley	Awww, don't worry too much, you two!
Anderson Park_Event26_Page3	Ingrid Shirley	I'm sure tomorrow everything will go back to the way it used to be.
Anderson Park_Event27_Page1	Neil Pekkanen	Hope you have a nice day.
Anderson Park_Event27_Page3	Neil Pekkanen	Keep your hands where I can see them.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page1	Vanessza Rye	Mhhh...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page1	Vanessza Rye	Can you smell the lavender too?
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Atlas?
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Yo!
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Uhm...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Everything okay?
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Your face...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Tanner got a bit overexcited.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Sorry to hear that.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	It's okay.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Not that I mind...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	But are you sure meeting like this is a good idea?
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	The more obvious the better.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	We're at war now.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Shit.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Don't worry.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	We're ready.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Thanks to you.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Glad it was worth it.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	For the record...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	It wasn't my-
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	I know, Atlas...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	I know.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Good.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Anyways...
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	We better get going.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	Where to?
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Elysian.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Ganymede	The safehouse?
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page2	Atlas	Let's go.
Anderson Park_Event29_Page4	Vanessza Rye	There's blood in the air.
Anderson Park_Event30_Page1	Arnold Stetham	And you wonder why everyone's avoiding you...
Anderson Park_Event30_Page3	Arnold Stetham	Where did Eddy go?
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Edward Clandestine	Didn't think the Guard had any spine left in 'em.
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Ganymede	Ahem.
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Edward Clandestine	Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir!
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Edward Clandestine	I didn't mean it like that!
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Ganymede	Now, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Ganymede	But I would be more careful about what I say from now on, if I were you.
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Edward Clandestine	Of course, sir!
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Ganymede	Glad we understand each other.
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Ganymede	Carry on, citizen.
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Edward Clandestine	N-naturally!
Anderson Park_Event32_Page1	Edward Clandestine	Hope you have a nice day, sir!
Anderson Park_Event32_Page2	Edward Clandestine	Hope you have a nice day, sir!
Anderson Park_Event33_Page1	Hein Barnett	Can I help you?
Anderson Park_Event34_Page1	Denis Marić	Keep moving, please.
Anderson Park_Event35_Page1	Kai Knepp	Stay safe, citizen.
Anderson Park_Event36_Page1	Evžen Severins	I've got my eye on you.
Anderson Park_Event37_Page1	Felix Hadzhiev	You don't find petunias like these, in most places.
Anderson Park_Event37_Page2	Felix Hadzhiev	All that work for nothing...
Anderson Park_Event39_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event40_Page1	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event48_Page1	Oskar Rebane	I think you really need to get a grip, man.
Anderson Park_Event48_Page3	Oskar Rebane	Can't believe they cancelled the carnival.
Anderson Park_Event49_Page1	Zinoviy Goranov	And I'm telling you, that the entire thing was an inside job!
Anderson Park_Event49_Page1	Zinoviy Goranov	There's no way these people could've busted him out without some serious firepower!
Anderson Park_Event49_Page3	Zinoviy Goranov	I know, right?
Anderson Park_Event49_Page3	Zinoviy Goranov	Might as well hand them the entire city, while we're at it.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page1	Suzana Monet	Hello, Mr. Hendrick.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	So that's the parliament, hm?
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	I'd really like to see what's inside.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Oh, hey.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Hm...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Something wrong?
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Mhh...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Say...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Would you like to go a date with me?
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Uhh...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Oh my!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	So hesitant...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	So timid!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	It's decided, then!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Come on.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	I don't have all day!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	I'm really sorry...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	But this is all a bit sudden, you know.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Hogwash!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Love doesn't care for earthly time.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Set yourself free...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Become one with your desires!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	And with me, if you like~
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass, thank you.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	But you know, I have a friend...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Tall guy, blue eyes.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Moustache and combed back hair.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Can't miss him.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Oh, I think I've seen someone like that, before!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	He looked so stern, I didn't dare.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	He's pretty shy.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	It's just a mask, believe me.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	If you say so!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Yeah, don't worry!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	I'm sure he'll be thrilled to get to know you better.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Great! I'm looking forward to seeing him, then~ And of course...
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	We can still have our little fling, if you want~
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Another time, maybe.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Anyways, I gotta go.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Was nice meeting you.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Likewise~
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Oh, and please don't tell my friend about this conversation.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	You know, shy and such.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	Of course!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Suzana Monet	It'll be our little secret~
Anderson Park_Event50_Page2	Ganymede	Right!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page4	Suzana Monet	Hehe, I hope your friend turns up, soon~ Ohh, do you look dashing in that uniform!
Anderson Park_Event50_Page5	Suzana Monet	I can't wait for your friend to turn up~ Just one last dance, before they close.
Anderson Park_Event50_Page7	Suzana Monet	Almost there.
Anderson Park_Event51_Page1	Martí Firenze	Aww, that's too bad!
Anderson Park_Event51_Page1	Martí Firenze	I really hoped you could pose for me.
Anderson Park_Event51_Page1	Martí Firenze	You're so beautiful, the picture would almost paint itself.
Anderson Park_Event52_Page1	Elene Trelleux	Oh, please!
Anderson Park_Event52_Page1	Elene Trelleux	You know I'm an art student, too, right?
Anderson Park_Event103_Page1	Mirko Górski	No.
Anderson Park_Event103_Page1	Mirko Górski	I've been put on leave since last week.
Anderson Park_Event103_Page3	Mirko Górski	They've asked me to be reinstated.
Anderson Park_Event103_Page3	Mirko Górski	But honestly...
Anderson Park_Event103_Page3	Mirko Górski	The Guard can go and fuck themselves.
Anderson Park_Event104_Page2	Ganymede	Safehouse is the other way.
Anderson Park_Event118_Page2	Ganymede	North: Gharten Street East: Trenton Plaza West: Stuart Alley South: Sigmund Plaza West: Farblein Trail
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	Yo Timo!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	What are you doing out here?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hey Stevo.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I'm on my way to Lashanka.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Mum asked me to grab some things from the market.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	You've got some guts showing yourself around here!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Huh?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	You know what I'm talking about!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Parading Anton around like you own him!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	We've been over this.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	He wanted to stay with me.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	That's a lie!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	You just bought him over!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	You're blaming me for feeding him?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	It's not fair!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	If you hadn't thrown a fit, he wouldn't have run away in the first place!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Fuck you!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	And you, just standing there!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	Listen, Timo...
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	I know you like Anton very much.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	But it's Apo's dog.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	You can't just take something away because you feel like it.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I didn't take him away.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	He just followed me back home.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	That doesn't make it less of a crime.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	How can you call that a crime?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	It's for Anton to decide who he wants to be with!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	That's not how it works, and you know that.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Enough!!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	If you don't want to give him back...
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Then I'll just take him.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Hey!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	It's me, Anton.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Let's go home.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	See?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	He doesn't want to.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Shut up, you thief!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Come on, Anton!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	What's wrong?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Don't you recognize me?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Alright.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I'm leaving.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Stop!!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Give him back!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Seriously, Apo...
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	How dense are you?
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	I'm clever enough to see what kind of shit you're pulling!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	You're trying to turn Anton against me!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I didn't do anything like that.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	You pushed him away all by yourself.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	How dare you!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	I'm taking him home now.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	And there's nothing you can do about it.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	Ouch!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	What the fuck!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Apostol Trajkovski	You stupid little...
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Stop it!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	You're hurting him!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	W-what?!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Let me go!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	I'm sorry, Timo.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Stevo Trajkovski	But it's his dog.
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	NO!!!
Crossroads_Event4_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	You little shit!
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	A letter?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Yeah.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	What's in it?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I can't tell you.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Seriously?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Sorry Timo.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But you know how it is.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Right.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Find someone else.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Timo...
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	This is important.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Then tell me about it!
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I won't play courier if I don't know what's going on.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You do realize that if you're caught...
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Knowing less is better?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	For you, maybe.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	But I'll need something to buy myself out, if push comes to shove.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You know I'd find a way to-
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Would you, really?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Because I know things about you?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Or because I'm your brother?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Can you please not mention that here?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	What part?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Alright.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	You win.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I told you about our new arrival, didn't I?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	That girl from EnKAD?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Yeah.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	She brought a gift with her.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I only had a brief look at it.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But it looks like they're planning a hit on Fredrick Dam.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	The one near Trachi?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Exactly.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	If that dam gets destroyed, there'll be massive floods in the entire area.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	I don't see how that's our problem.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Trachi isn't part of Ionia, anymore.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	External affairs are our territory.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	And you don't want them pissing on us.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	If anything goes wrong...
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	CoExA will be implicated, too.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Of course.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	In any case...
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Fero wants to check it out.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	What if it's fake?
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Then we at least know that someone's trying to bullshit us.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	This is too big to ignore.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	And they know it.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Alright.
Lorentz Office_Event6_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Who do I give this to?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	It's been three days, already, hm.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Feels like yesterday.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Yeah.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Before we go...
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	There's something I've got to tell you.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	It can't wait?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Sorry.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	But I already waited eight agonizing years.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You know that I love you, right?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	How would I know?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You never asked yourself why I'm so fiercely loyal to you?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Because it's part of your job?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I'm serious, Atlas.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Sorry.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	But I don't believe it.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You think I'd make this up?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I'm not questioning your love...
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	But your loyalty.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Very good, actually.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Let me rephrase the question, then.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Why do you think I haven't killed you, yet?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Do you want to kill me?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	It's only natural, I think.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Because of what I did to Daniil?
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	And because you sold me and my mother out.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Atlas	If it's an apology you want-
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Don't make me laugh.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	We've been through all that a thousand times, already.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I don't want another apology.
Sewers (Boat)_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I want you to know the truth.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	It's been three days, already, hm.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Feels like yesterday.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Yeah.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Before we go...
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	There's something I've got to tell you.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	It can't wait?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Sorry.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	But I already waited eight agonizing years.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	You know that I love you, right?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	How would I know?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	You never asked yourself why I'm so fiercely loyal to you?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Because it's part of your job?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I'm serious, Atlas.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Sorry.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	But I don't believe it.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	You think I'd make this up?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'm not questioning your love...
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	But your loyalty.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Very good, actually.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Let me rephrase the question, then.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Why do you think I haven't killed you, yet?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Do you want to kill me?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	It's only natural, I think.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Because of what I did to Daniil?
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	And because you sold me and my mother out.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	If it's an apology you want-
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Don't make me laugh.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	We've been through all that a thousand times, already.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I don't want another apology.
Sewers (Boat)_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I want you to know the truth.
Sewers (Boat)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	No turning back now.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	How is he?
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	As you might expect.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I see.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	So...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Are you gonna let him go, now?
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Considering both Atlas and Orpheus are still at large...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I doubt that's a good idea.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Then again, I promised you.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	So I'd like to hear your opinion on it.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	He's utterly broken.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	But I agree.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	It's too risky to set him loose.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	A shame.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	There might be a way to use him, though.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	And maybe...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Flush both Atlas and Orpheus out.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Are you suggesting-
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I am.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Alright.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	But if he's going there...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	He'll need a new identity.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	And I just happen to know the perfect handle.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Good.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I'll leave the details to you.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Thank you.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	No, thank you.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	You've been an incredible help the past few years.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	If there weren't that many reservations about age...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I'd have named you as Fero's successor.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I'm honoured.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	But I don't think I'm ready for politics, yet.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	No one ever is.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	You'd certainly make a better secretary than any of the half-wits at this table.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Speaking of that...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I'll have to get ready for the meeting.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Of course.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Is there anything else you need from me?
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Not at the moment, no.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	It's been a busy couple of days.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	If there's no complications, today...
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Both of us will have a lot of work on our hands, very soon.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	So why don't you go and get some rest?
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Okay.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I'll have my assistant call you tomorrow.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Alright.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Thank you.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	And good luck.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Always an eye for details, huh?
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You know how it is.
Committee Room_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Some things never change.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	I take it we are all in agreement?
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	Good.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	Mr. Prawnfield.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	If you'd be so kind and report your findings to the committee.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	Ahem.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	The current situation in Trachi is as follows: Due to Mayor Farnswood's refusal to cooperate, we have been forced to enact stage 3.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	As the minister of foreign affairs rightfully pointed out, our ambassador and his staff have been successfully relocated to the custom's office.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	At around 3:00 AM this morning, our agents successfully managed to convince their assigned union leaders to occupy both the central station and the dockyards.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	Currently, the Trachian guard is attempting to nego-
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	tiate with the unions, but we assess that their ventures will not bear fruit.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	So we expect the Guard to storm the occupied places very soon.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	What about our assets within the Guard?
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	I'm afraid to report that we lost a significant portion of our men to a comprehensive purge yesterday.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	How is that possible?
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	We are not sure yet.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	But we assume that our assetts weren't the sole target.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	Instead, the goal was to purge not only foreign elements, but everyone barring except those who are assumed loyal to the Farnswood faction.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	Judging by the reports given of our remaining assetts, this move leaves the Guard severely understaffed.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	The TLF, commanded by one of our assetts, has thus taken control over the northeastern parts of the city.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	However, since we were forced to act earlier than planned...
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	We were forced to abandon Trenton Plaza this morning.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	Regardless, we have successfully managed to rig all the bridges in the city's interior.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	And have placed people on standby to detonate as soon as the Republican Guard has sent their vanguard across.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	Furthermore, a unit has been dispatched to the city's eastern checkpoint in order to establish another route into the city.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Prawnfield	We expect to hear from them within the next few hours.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	Good.
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	Mr. Ecklart...
Committee Room_Event1_Page3	Chairman Walton	I take it our naval forces are on standby?
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	I appreciate your trust in me very much.
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	And humbly accept my new position as General Secretary.
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Now, as for the issue of my replacement as Secretary of State Security...
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	We will need to find a new candidate.
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	In the meantime, I will continue to lead the Secretariat as an intermediary.
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	All in favour?
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Aye!
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	Thank you, for everything.
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	And we're looking forward to see you in Trachi, again.
Committee Room_Event7_Page1	Teron Pravoskos	With the deepest admiration: A brother, and a friend.
Second Level_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I should go and see Lily.
Second Level_Event5_Page1	Petre Križman	Please behave yourself.
Second Level_Event6_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I should go and see Lily.
Second Level_Event15_Page1	Marek Kovač	I wonder how much this'll go for...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Daphne	We need to talk.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Is that so?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Daphne	That Tillian guy you sent with us.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Daphne	He's one of Amryn's people.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	What?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Why would you think that?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Because it's true.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Atlas?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Tell me...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Was it you?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	I don't know what you're talking about.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Cut the bullshit!
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	You told Eury about arteria, didn't you?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Of course I did.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Just like you ordered me to.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Right.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Somehow, this information ended up with Amryn.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Now, how did that happen, I wonder?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	I'm sure you'll tell me in a second.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	As it stands, there are two possibilities.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	They either got it from Eury...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Or you.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	So?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Which do you think it is?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Hm.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	I'm quite baffled that you of all people would ask me that question.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Kristofor De Bloom	Seeing as you were the one who brought her to me.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	To watch her, yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Tell me, then...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Where is she?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Would you mind explaining yourself?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Sorry, Daph.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But I had to make sure.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Stop speaking in riddles, already.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You asked me why I didn't turn Eury in, right?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	\n<AtlasIt's true.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I have to protect her.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But not from us.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Pravoskos told you, didn't he?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	We needed to put up a show for Eury.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	So she could get close to Lorentz.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	And? Did she find him?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Not yet.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But they've set up a meeting.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Where?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I don't know, yet.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	And you think he's really here?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	He has to be.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	His fingerprints are all over Amryn's movements Including Ganymede.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	You were right about him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	He really was working for Lorentz, then?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	All the signs are pointing to it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	A shame.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	He's a very bright young man.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Some people can't be trusted, I guess.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Right.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You want to send him back?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	It was fun, while it lasted...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	But I already got what I wanted from him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I'll file the papers once we get back.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Okay.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Something still bothers me, though.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	What?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	I don't know...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	It just feels like I don't know who to trust, anymore.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Welcome to my world.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	The bad news is, you'll never get used to| it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But we can try, at least.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Looks like they're ready.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You want to see this?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Let's get it over with.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Good enough.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	How did it go?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Good enough.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I got what I wanted.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Where is he now?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Still in the archives.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	But I've got someone watching him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I see.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I take it you've heard the news?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I have.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	It's tragic.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Did you plan for this to happen?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Of course not!
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	As a matter of fact, this incident puts us in a highly problematic spot.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	The mayor will have no choice but to go after us now.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	With everything he's got.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Worse yet...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	The death of his daugther will certainly put the general public behind him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	As for us...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	We had to make our move a lot sooner than originally planned.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	How did it go on your end?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	We've managed to secure the perimeter.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	For the time.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	But I hope Solka's men are on their way.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	He's been notified.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	It shouldn't take them long to get here.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	What about the other members of the staff here?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I'm going to need a list of all the people with acess to this building.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Including Lily?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Do you think she should be here?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I don't know where else she'd be safe.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	You understand she poses a security risk, right?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	If you want, we could bring her to one of our safehouses.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I appreciate the offer.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	But I'm sure you'll understand your recent track record in that area isn't promising.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I'd rather keep her close to me.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Just know that she can't be involved into any of this.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	For your and her sake, mainly.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Yeah, I get it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	So, what's the next step?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	First order of business is to establish a safe supply route back to Ionia.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Since the guardsmen at the checkpoint are unlikely to cooperate, we need to rely on alternative methods.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	In other words, we're going to need ships.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	And lots of them.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	We need an account of everything that can be used as transport.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Including small crafts, such as Gondole.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	You're asking me to disown my own citizens.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Only temporarily...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Once we've established control over the checkpoint, everyone will get their property back.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I think you know this already...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	But we can't use any forces oficially affiliated with Ionia.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Not until Amryn has made their move.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Which means...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	There is no other option here.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Apart from fending completely on our own.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	And I think you of all people are aware how long this city can survive without food supplies.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I guess there's no helping it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	In return however, I want something from you, as well.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I don't care about status or position.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	What I do care about is that Lily.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Of course.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	If anything goes wrong, she's the among the first to be exfiltrated.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	And returned to her tometown safely.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I hope I can believe your word.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Naturally.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	On that note...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Once Ionia has gained control over the city...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	You'll be free, as agreed.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Retire to the countryside with your wife...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Or keep serving as governor.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	It's your call.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Very well...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	What about the others?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Who?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Farnswood and his gang.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	That depends on him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	From our end, we're not unwilling to go back to the negotiation table.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	But I doubt he's willing to talk after what happened.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Not after what happened yesterday.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	That being said, if there's nothing else to discuss...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Daphne	I'm going to get some rest.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page3	Drenem	I'll have someone notify you if anything happens.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Would you mind explaining yourself?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Sorry, Daph.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	But I had to make sure.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Stop speaking in riddles, already.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	You asked me why I didn't turn Eury in, right?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	\n<AtlasIt's true.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	I have to protect her.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	But not from us.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Pravoskos told you, didn't he?

Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	And? Did she find him?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Not yet.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	But they've set up a meeting.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Where?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	An appartment in Stuart Alley.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	And you think he's really here?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	He has to be.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	His fingerprints are all over Amryn's movements Including Ganymede.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	You were right about him.

Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Right.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	You want to send him back?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	It was fun, while it lasted...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	But I already got what I wanted from him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	I'll file the papers once we get back.

Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Something still bothers me, though.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	What?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	I don't know...
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	It just feels like I don't know who to trust, anymore.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Welcome to my world.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	The bad news is, you'll never get used to| it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	But we can try, at least.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	Looks like they're ready.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Atlas	You want to see this?
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Yeah.
Harbourmaster's office_Event2_Page4	Daphne	Let's get it over with.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	And that's only the intro.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Do you like it, so far?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Hm.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You really think he's worth all that?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Silly girl.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I told you I'm not in this for someone else.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	All I care about...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Is to see things burn.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So how about it?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Want me to put a stop to it?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You really enjoy this, don't you?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Am I supposed to feel guilty for that?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Not at all.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	On the contrary...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You did everything just the way we wanted you to.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Really?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I think you're bluffing, Daph.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I thought you might say that.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	It just fits you so perfectly well.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And since you're trying so hard to keep that mask of yours up...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I'm going to enjoy this even more than I thought!
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You like to see things burn, you said.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	There's about twenty to thirty armed men outside.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	God...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	The suspense is killing me.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Here we go.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Watch me.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Your colleague is here as well?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Yup.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	He's resting, hopefully.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I see.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	How is he?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Good, all things considered.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I take it you've heard the news?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I have.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	It's tragic.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Did you plan for this to happen?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Of course not!
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	As a matter of fact, this incident puts us in a highly problematic spot.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	The mayor will have no choice but to go after us now.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	With everything he's got.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Worse yet...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	The death of his daugther will certainly put the general public behind him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	As for us...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	We had to make our move a lot sooner than originally planned.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	How did it go on your end?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	We've managed to secure the perimeter.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	For the time.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	But I hope Solka's men are on their way.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	He's been notified.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	It shouldn't take them long to get here.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	What about the other members of the staff here?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I'm going to need a list of all the people with acess to this building.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Including Lily?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Do you think she should be here?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I don't know where else she'd be safe.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You understand she poses a security risk, right?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	If you want, we could bring her to one of our safehouses.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I appreciate the offer.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	But I'm sure you'll understand your recent track record in that area isn't promising.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I'd rather keep her close to me.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Just know that she can't be involved into any of this.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	For your and her sake, mainly.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Yeah, I get it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	So, what's the next step?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	First order of business is to establish a safe supply route back to Ionia.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Since the guardsmen at the checkpoint are unlikely to cooperate, we need to rely on alternative methods.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	In other words, we're going to need ships.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	And lots of them.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	We need an account of everything that can be used as transport.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Including small crafts, such as Gondole.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	You're asking me to disown my own citizens.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Only temporarily...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Once we've established control over the checkpoint, everyone will get their property back.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I think you know this already...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But we can't use any forces oficially affiliated with Ionia.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Not until Amryn has made their move.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Which means...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	There is no other option here.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Apart from fending completely on our own.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	And I think you of all people are aware how long this city can survive without food supplies.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I guess there's no helping it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	In return however, I want something from you, as well.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I don't care about status or position.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	What I do care about is that Lily.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Of course.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	If anything goes wrong, she's the among the first to be exfiltrated.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	And returned to her tometown safely.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I hope I can believe your word.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Naturally.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	On that note...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Once Ionia has gained control over the city...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You'll be free, as agreed.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Retire to the countryside with your wife...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Or keep serving as governor.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	It's your call.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Very well...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	What about the others?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Who?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Farnswood and his gang.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	That depends on him.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	From our end, we're not unwilling to go back to the negotiation table.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But I doubt he's willing to talk after what happened.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Not after what happened yesterday.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	That being said, if there's nothing else to discuss...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I'm going to get some rest.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page3	Drenem	I'll have someone notify you if anything happens.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	You seem to have settled in, nicely.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	Not at all.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	I managed to mobilise far less people than I thought.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	What about the rest?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	I managed to mobilise far less people than I thought.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	I let them go, of course.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	You sure that's wise?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	I don't see any option.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	We can't claim to be liberators if we're holding people against their will.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	Well, you're in charge.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	As long as you're aware that now, more so than ever, your decisions affect not only yourself.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	I wish you people would stop uttering those thinly veiled threats at every opportunity.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	I'm just telling you how it is.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	In any case...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	When is the shipment going to arrive?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	An hour from now, at most.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	Alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Drenem	The success of our movement depends on it.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	If that's all, I'm gonna head out.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page5	Daphne	Keep us posted in case something happens.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Apart from trying to make the best out of a bad situation.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	On that matter–
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	Before you continue, there's one thing I need to know first.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Yes, yes...
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	She is safe, I assure you.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	I'd like to see her, if that's possible.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	In due time, Mr. Hendricks.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	First, we need to make sure that Rondham and its sorrounding area is safe.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	You don't need to be concerned about that.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	Farnswood has already withdrawn his men back to Trenton Plaza.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	He can't afford to keep a presence here.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	Oh, he'll have his hands full, alright.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	And soon, that is.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	How is the operation in Reginald coming along?
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	We don't know, yet.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Daphne	But if all went well, we should hear from them, soon.
Harbourmaster's office_Event3_Page6	Drenem	So, where to from here?
Eastern Wing_Event1_Page1	Toma Lončar	Whose idea was it to sort stuff from Z-A?
Eastern Wing_Event2_Page1	Luka Mlakar	Yo, they actually have a file on me!
Eastern Wing_Event3_Page1	Simeon Korošec	Why do I always get the boring jobs?
Eastern Wing_Event6_Page1	Niko Jež	This place is a mess!
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Julius Gaston	Told you that these guys would be trouble.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Not like any of us ever trusted them, in the first place.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	In any case, though...
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	We might as well make our own plans, now.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	If only it were that easy.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	For all we know, any of the people here\ could be one of their agents.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Julius Gaston	Right.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Julius Gaston	We need to make sure the coast is clear, first.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	I don't think we'll have time for that.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	From what Kristofor said, they're incredibly close.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Julius Gaston	Are they still interrogating that lad?
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Yeah.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	I'd reckon we have a few hours left, at most.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Julius Gaston	I see.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Julius Gaston	Want me to get the boys ready?
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	It's a shame really.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	But it looks like we'll have to mobilize.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Alright.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Here's the keys to the house.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	You're not coming with us?
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll be there, don't worry.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Just want to say goodbye to Lily, first.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	Okay.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page1	Heinrich Navrátil	We'll see you there.
Eastern Wing_Event7_Page2	Heinrich Navrátil	I'll see you later.
Eastern Wing_Event8_Page1	Julius Gaston	Good luck Drenem.
Prefecture_Event1_Page1	Antti Rounds	Sorry sir, only authorized personnel allowed.
Prefecture_Event1_Page2	Antti Rounds	Hey there.
Prefecture_Event1_Page3	Antti Rounds	Get out of here.
Prefecture_Event5_Page1	Colbert Gotti	What a day...
Prefecture_Event6_Page1	Aitor Pintér	I heard Laurence got the sack, yesterday.
Prefecture_Event7_Page1	Kit Sitz	Man, these guys sure like to take their time.
Prefecture_Event8_Page1	Harut Vasylyk	I was here first!
Prefecture_Event9_Page1	Rocky Bakó	Seriously...
Prefecture_Event9_Page1	Rocky Bakó	How am I supposed to make something out of this?
Prefecture_Event10_Page1	Seòras Duerr	I just want my things back...
Prefecture_Event11_Page2	Ganymede	I need to grab my things, first.
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	W-what?
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	W-where am I?
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	Oh god...
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	Hey!!
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	Someone there?!
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	Get me out!
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	Help me...
Prefecture_Event11_Page3	Ganymede	PLEASE!!!
Prefecture_Event12_Page1	Ganymede	Here we go.
Prefecture_Event13_Page2	Ganymede	I should go.
Prefecture_Event14_Page2	Ganymede	I need to grab my things, first.
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	W-what?
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	W-where am I?
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	Oh god...
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	Hey!!
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	Someone there?!
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	Get me out!
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	Help me...
Prefecture_Event14_Page3	Ganymede	PLEASE!!!
Prefecture_Event15_Page1	Artair Tatton	Stop pushing.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Gael Berardi	Oh...
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Gael Berardi	It's you.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	You got my things?
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Gael Berardi	There you go.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Thanks.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Looks like it's all there.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Hm?
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	A message?
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	17.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Uhhh....
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Where was that again?
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Oh, right!
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Okay.
Prefecture_Event16_Page2	Ganymede	Let's go.
Prefecture_Event16_Page3	Gael Berardi	Move along.
Prefecture_Event18_Page1	Antti Rounds	Sorry sir, only authorized personnel allowed.
Prefecture_Event18_Page4	Antti Rounds	Get out of here.
Prefecture_Event19_Page1	Jeremias Valenti	Galson Alley, huh?
Prefecture_Event19_Page2	Jeremias Valenti	God, I hope they manage to find that poor girl soon.
Hallway_Event6_Page1	Žan Ciobanu	Yeah, from what I heard the mayor visited one of his friends.
Hallway_Event6_Page1	Žan Ciobanu	And suddenly, his daughter was gone.
Hallway_Event6_Page1	Žan Ciobanu	Just like that.
Hallway_Event16_Page1	Ferdo Kopitar	Holy shit...
Hallway_Event16_Page1	Ferdo Kopitar	That's fucked up, man.
Downstairs_Event6_Page1	Elias Vlasák	It just seems so weird that the moment this guy walks in, we've got a full squad of people there.
Downstairs_Event9_Page1	Tsvetan Hájek	I don't know who tipped us off.
Downstairs_Event9_Page1	Tsvetan Hájek	But some guys are saying that the notice came from one of Amryn's people.
Downstairs_Event16_Page1	Artemis Matić	Can't believe we're letting this guy go.
Second Level_Event1_Page1	Kenyon Aubert	And I'm telling you that you can't trust these guys.
Second Level_Event1_Page1	Kenyon Aubert	You know what they did to that one guy they arrested, right?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	This should be it.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Hm...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Looks like he's not in, yet.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Hey!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	You need something from the Colonel?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Well, tough luck.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	He left like an hour ago.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Damn.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Say, have we met before?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Not that I can think of.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Hm...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Might just be my mind playing tricks on me, then.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	In any case...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	I'm Herbert.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Theodore.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	You want me to relay a message to the Colonel?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Thanks, but it's fine.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I don't mind waiting.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Alright.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	I'll get back to work, then.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Don't let me keep you.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Was nice meeting you, Theodore.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	I totally forgot!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	I'm terribly sorry...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	But we've been having an influx on new people, lately.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	So the Colonel asked me to conduct a check on all the personnel.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Oh?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Would you mind showing me your identification, real quick?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Not at all.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Thank you.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Let's see...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Theodore Harrington...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Wait a second...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Are you related to Freddy?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Freddy?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Frederick Harrington.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Tall, blonde guy.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Oh!
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	No, I don't think so.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	At the very least, I never met him.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Oh, okay then.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	You're from Trachi proper?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Born and raised.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Uh-huh.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	That's quite curious.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	How so?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Well, your accent reminds me a bit of the countryside.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Is that so?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	The truth is...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Both of my parents are from Verin.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	They moved here a few years before I was born.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Oh! That explains it.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Hm...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	When were these papers issued?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Uhh...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I don't remember the exact date.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But it must've been a week, or two ago.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Hmm.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	I might be wrong...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	But looks like the identification is based on an old numbering system.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	I'm sorry, but I'll have to check up on this.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Of course.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Would you come with me, please?
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Well...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm not sure the Colonel would appreciate my report being delayed.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	No need to worry about that.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Should just take a moment.
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Alright...
Second Level_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	If you insist.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	Well, I'm not sure if the Lieutenant would appreciate not getting this report.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	I don't remember the exact date...
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Guard	Hmm..
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Guard	Sorry again for the inconvenience.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	No problem at all.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Guard	Appreciate your understanding.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Guard	I'll be around, if you need anything.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	Sure thing.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	There you go.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Guard	We definitely Alright.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Guard	Alright.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	Not really.
Second Level_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	I just recently joined the guard.
Second Level_Event4_Page2	Ganymede	I shouldn't let him wait.
Second Level_Event4_Page3	Ganymede	He went upstairs.
Second Level_Event5_Page1	Adam Grgić	I get that.
Second Level_Event5_Page1	Adam Grgić	We're still on the same team, though.
Second Level_Event6_Page1	Vasil Skeates	How about the two of you concentrate on your work, instead of bickering all day?
Second Level_Event8_Page1	Benedykt Leitner	Are you lost?
Second Level_Event9_Page1	Iván Nyitrai	Where did I put that, again?
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Colonel!
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	You're back already.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	Yes.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	I have some things to take care of.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	I'll be in my office.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	Excuse me, Colonel.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	But I urgently need to talk to you.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	Is that so?
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	I'm not sure I recognize you.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	Corporal Harrington, sir.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	You wanted my report on the Staffold case.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	I see.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	Well then, corporal.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	I'll see you in my office.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Sorry, sir.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	But may I speak with you beforehand?
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	It'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	Understood!
Second Level_Event10_Page1	Arnold Solka	If you'd follow me, please.
Second Level_Event11_Page1	Veikko Silveira	Come on, man.
Second Level_Event11_Page1	Veikko Silveira	I just need to recheck something real quick.
Second Level_Event16_Page1	Herbert Ziętek	You cool?
Second Level_Event16_Page2	Herbert Ziętek	I got my eyes on you.
Second Level_Event17_Page1	Zrinko Smirnov	I told you that I can't let you into the archives without Solka's permission.
Roof_Event16_Page1	Hazan Iordanou	Hey.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	What am I supposed to see here?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	You've just recently arrived, haven't you?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	So what?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	There are about forty-two thousand people living in Trachi.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Add to that an uncountable amount of visitors.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	The point, if you'd please.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Haven't you noticed...
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	That there's barely anyone about?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Of course you haven't.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	For you, this atmosphere is your natural habitat.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	The thing you create and foster in.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Don't get me wrong.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	I know this city has its faults.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	And how rotten it can be.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	But at least people were able to walk the streets without fear.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	What are you getting at?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	I don't know how much you stand behind what you're representing.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	In any case...
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	You need to be aware of the consequences your actions cause.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	For each and every one of them.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Is that all?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	You're an impatient one.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Just like he said.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Who told you what?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	One of your associates.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	The one who's made up his mind.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	This is why you're here, right?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	To find out if it's true.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	You need to be more specific than that.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	I can't.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Because you don't know?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	As you said it.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	You've been in contact with that person?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Indirectly.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Who's the middle-man?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	One of my sergeants.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	A reclusive persona.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	But very thorough.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Can I meet him?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	I would advise against it.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	He's not very welcoming to strangers.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Even so.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Alright.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	He's on leave right now.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Politics and such.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Where does he live?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	You've been to Trenton Plaza?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Then you've also seen the big apartment building there?
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	I have.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Second floor.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Apartment 2-C.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Tell him I sent you.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Code phrase: "insubordinant briard".
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	I'll be underway, then.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	One more thing: If you insist on visiting that man...
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Make sure to change beforehand.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	There's no telling how he'd react if some-
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	one in a uniform turns up at his doorstep.
Balcony_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Good luck.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	Ha!
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	Oh, you'll find out soon enough.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Alright then.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Alright then.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	I know we're not always in control of our actions.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	And sometimes, we have to cross a line.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	Pledging that this is the last time, for real.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	But both of us know...
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	It won't end.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	We'll do it again and again.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	And everytime, we get more entangled.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	That's all nice and well...
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	But I'm afraid I don't have time for philosophical debates.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	So if you don't have anything else to share, I'll take my leave.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	Alright.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	Alright.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	Be aware of the consequences your actions cause.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	And don't trust anyone that is being pressured by someone else than you.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	And I doubt you've committed as many misdeeds as I have in my time.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Solka	It's not too late for you.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	Alright.
Balcony_Event1_Page3	Ganymede	I'm leaving.
Balcony_Event2_Page1	Arnold Solka	I think we're done here.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	So...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	I take it you're the man from the IIS?
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Yup.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Good.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	I'm sorry about the circumstances of this meeting.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	But unfortunately, there's a lot of eyes directed towards me, lately.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Don't worry about it.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Though I think it's best if we get straight to the point.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Agreed.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	I'll be frank with you...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	There's a wide a range of influential people trying to replace me.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	After what happened at the checkpoint yesterday...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	A considerable number of Guardsmen have been reposted from the outskirts to the urban branches.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Among them there's a Lieutenant, which, from what I know, you've already met.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I see where this is going.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	In fact...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	He's one of the reasons why I'm here.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	I'm glad we're on the same page, then.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	In any case...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Here's his file.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Unfortunately, it won't tell you much you don't already know.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	So let me add the following remarks...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Lieutenant Tanner is a brute.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	But not without a sense of shrewdness.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	That, and his ability to establish political contacts...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Made him gather a sizeable herd of loyal servicemen.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Mostly from his own branch, working the checkpoints.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	But his popularity, even within the urban sections, has grown exponentially.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	There was another man...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Heinrich, if I recall correctly.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	A good man.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	But far too ideological.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Freedom fighters don't always make good politicians.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Some of them are far too stuck in their own beliefs...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	And would rather let someone else take charge.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Heinrich refused to encourage unorthodox ways of policing.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	And held up high the ideal of a valiant, uncorruptable Guardsman.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	This made him somewhat unpopular with certain parts of the Guard.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Tanner only had to swoop down and take the opportunity.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Supported by the mayor, of course.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Who was very keen on the prospect of gaining a more or less loyal asset within the Guard.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Lieutenant Tanner...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Is a pragmatist.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Of course, he proclaims that it's all for the good of the city.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	That it's time for Trachi to enter the world stage as a force to be reckoned with.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	It's tomfoolery of absurd proportions.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	But it works.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	How dependent is he on Faber?
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	He still needs him, of course.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	But that's not to say he wouldn't serve someone else, if the opportunity presents itself.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	In other words...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	If you want to hit Tanner, you can't simply do this through his host.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	You need to strike at him directly.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	His address is still the same?
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	From what I know.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Okay.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Say...
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Would you mind if I showed you something?
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	Like what?
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	Something you should definitely see for yourself.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	If you'd be so kind and follow me.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Ganymede	I'm not here to play games, you know.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	I am aware of that.
Solka Office_Event16_Page1	Arnold Solka	It won't take long.
Stuart Alley_Event1_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	I bet it was one of the Guardsmen.
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	The people working the checkpoints are some real ruffians, I heard!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Excuse me?
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	Oh god!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	I'm sorry!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Don't worry.
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I won't tell on you.
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Or will I?
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	Please don't!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	I'm really, really sorry!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Relax!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm just messing with you!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	Haha, of course!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	But still...
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Vera Marshall	I'll be more careful in the future!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Wise.
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page2	Vera Marshall	Hope you have a nice day, sir!
Stuart Alley_Event3_Page3	Vera Marshall	To be fair, they were more or less thrown out of the city, two years ago.
Stuart Alley_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event5_Page1	Tadeo Velasco	No way!
Stuart Alley_Event5_Page1	Tadeo Velasco	My brother was at the checkpoint too, yesterday.
Stuart Alley_Event5_Page2	Tadeo Velasco	Yeah!
Stuart Alley_Event5_Page2	Tadeo Velasco	I'm with them on this.
Stuart Alley_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event7_Page1	Nye Ellery	They say that someone in the crowd fired first.
Stuart Alley_Event7_Page1	Nye Ellery	Who would do such a thing?
Stuart Alley_Event7_Page2	Nye Ellery	Why would the Militia do something like that?
Stuart Alley_Event9_Page2	Roland Vadas	Hehehe.
Stuart Alley_Event9_Page2	Roland Vadas	Who's laughing now, Farnsi?
Stuart Alley_Event10_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Daphne	You really think that's going to work?
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Atlas	Sorry.
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Atlas	Old habits die hard, I guess.
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Daphne	Come on, Atlas.
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Daphne	I know you're tired and all.
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Daphne	But I really can't take it anymore!
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Atlas	Right.
Stuart Alley_Event11_Page2	Atlas	Let's get this over with.
Stuart Alley_Event12_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event13_Page2	Daphne	Stop stalling.
Stuart Alley_Event15_Page1	Daphne	North: Filmore Avenue East: Anderson Park South: Farblein Trail
Stuart Alley_Event15_Page1	Bronislav Radu	No time like the present.
Stuart Alley_Event26_Page1	Brin Mlakar	Trachi's ours!
Stuart Alley_Event27_Page1	Miloslav Kozel	Time's a wasting.
Stuart Alley_Event29_Page1	Dan Slováček	When it rains it pours, eh?
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Lorna Faragó	HEY!
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Hm?
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Daphne	You okay?
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Just... memories.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Are we ready?
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Daphne	Yup.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Daphne	We got him cornered.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Daphne	The kill is yours.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Stuart Alley_Event30_Page1	Atlas	Let's finish this.
Stuart Alley_Event31_Page1	Bashkim Spyros	We got your back, don't worry.
Farblein Trail_Event3_Page1	Rosa Kendal	You know the big apartment building in Trenton?
Farblein Trail_Event3_Page1	Rosa Kendal	I heard there's some really shady people living there.
Farblein Trail_Event3_Page1	Rosa Kendal	Like, people who really, really value their privacy.
Farblein Trail_Event3_Page2	Rosa Kendal	Really?
Farblein Trail_Event3_Page2	Rosa Kendal	God, is no one safe, anymore?
Farblein Trail_Event5_Page1	Gord Cavey	Two days, and I'll be traversing the seas again.
Farblein Trail_Event7_Page1	Laura Warren	Yeah!
Farblein Trail_Event7_Page1	Laura Warren	One of my classmates works there as a portier.
Farblein Trail_Event7_Page1	Laura Warren	And she told me that there was this totally suspicious looking guy.
Farblein Trail_Event7_Page1	Laura Warren	Apparently, he hasn't left his house for weeks, now.
Farblein Trail_Event7_Page2	Laura Warren	You didn't hear this from me...
Farblein Trail_Event7_Page2	Laura Warren	But I heard that he was killed by some spy from Ionia.
Farblein Trail_Event12_Page1	Laura Warren	North: Stuart Alley East: Anderson Park
Farblein Trail_Event12_Page1	Ervin Tomic	Stay on your toes, citizen.
Sewers Exit_Event9_Page1	Ganymede	No turning back, now.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	No turning back now.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event1_Page2	Atlas	No turning back now.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Back in the sewers.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	You going to be alright?
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Where are we headed?
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Eastwards.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Just follow the trail until we're at the end.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Alright.
Sewers (Safehouse)_Event6_Page1	Ganymede	No turning back now.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	It's the other way.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event2_Page3	Atlas	It's west of here.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Watch your step.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page1	Ganymede	How much further?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Almost there.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Gany!
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page2	Daphne	W-what?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page2	Daphne	Where... am I?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page2	Daphne	I-i can't breathe!
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page2	Daphne	S-someone help me!
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event4_Page2	Daphne	I don't want to die!
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event8_Page1	Atlas	Wait.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event8_Page1	Ganymede	What's wrong?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event8_Page1	Atlas	There should be a patrol passing through here, any minute.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event8_Page1	Atlas	See that door to your right?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event8_Page1	Atlas	There's a maintenance area in there.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event8_Page2	Ganymede	It's the other way.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	Careful there.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ganymede	That spot is pretty dangerous.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ariadne	Thank you for your concern.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ariadne	But I'll have you know that I've traversed these sewers more than often enough.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ariadne	Is that so?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Keep your hands where I can see them.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ariadne	Drenem?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Sorry, Lily.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But you left me no choice.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You thought you could just put me out of it, didn't you?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ariadne	I'm sorry, Drenem.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Ariadne	But you know how it is.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I do.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Though there's one question on my mind.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Was it ever more than just business for you?
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	On second thought...
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I don't really care.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Goodbye, Liliane.
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	As for you...
Sewers (Pike Bridge)_Event10_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You're going home.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Gany...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Jesus...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	What the hell did they do to you?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Don't worry about it.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Just a few scratches, that's all.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Sorry you had to go through that.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	It's alright.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	And worth it.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Hm?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	What do you mean?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I think it's time we talked.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	For real, I mean.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Is that so?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Alright.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Fire at will.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I know you killed Icarus.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	And I know that you did all of that just to get to me.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You were there, weren't you?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Both you and Atlas.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You naughty, naughty boys...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Tucked away in that tight little bedroom.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Listening eagerly.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	While I turned the man you loved inside out.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'd rather we skip the bullshit.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Aww!
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Is that you...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Ganymede?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	To be frank...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I couldn't give less of a shit about him.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	If I did...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You'd be dangling from a streetlight, already.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Mhhh.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Now that's more like it.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I don't know if it's your battered face or the sudden change of behaviour...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	But it's getting me excited.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Now, now...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Don't stop!
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Because the moment you do...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I'll tear you apart.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Oh, don't worry.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm just getting started!
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Atlas told me something about you.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	How he visited your father, back when you were twelve.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	The delighted look on your face, every time he arrived.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	And the sobbing mess you became, as soon as he left.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Love is an awkward thing, isn't it?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	When he told you that it was him...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Who sold you and your mother out.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Did your love for him stop?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Or was that just the final push you needed?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Big words...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	But I've heard those a million times, already.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Everyone thinks they can see through him.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Believe me, I've been there.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	At some point...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	He'll trash you, too.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Maybe, yeah.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But then again...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm not half as deaf as you and the others are.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I found something, Daph.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Just before I was arrested.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Records of our movements.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Both in the past...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	And the future.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	The meeting with Solka was a setup.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Trying to lure one of us into a trap.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I walked into it.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Because I wanted to make sure.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I wanted to see it with my own eyes.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Daph.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I know you pushed me, back when we arrived.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But I also know that in reality...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You don't really care about me.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	For you, I'm just a tool.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Because it's not me you're really after.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	It's Atlas.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You want-
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	No...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You NEED to know.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	If the man...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Who you just can't seem to shake off -
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Is a fucking traitor.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'll put your mind to rest, don't worry.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Because I know something you don't.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You're about to lose everything.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Because if what Atlas is trying to pull off works...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Ionia can kiss this city goodbye.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So how about it?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Are we friends again?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Lorna.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Yup.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	We better go upstairs.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	It's starting.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Atlas told you?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Among other things.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Alright.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Through here.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Up the ladder.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Revenge.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Gany...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I thought we were past this.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	That's not what I mean.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I'm not faulting you.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	To be honest...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	It's much a better cause than anything I have.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Hm.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	What is it for you, then?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Joy.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	To see something dismantled.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And rebuilt.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	That's why I'm here.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Nice speech.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But we both know it's bullshit.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You're here because your boss wants my boss out.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Everything else is just a narrative to cope with that fact.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	So tell me...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Am I on the hitlist, too?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	If I was supposed to kill you two...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Answer the question.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Neither of is.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Fero can fuck himself.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	The only reason why I do these things...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Is because it turns me on.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Hm...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	So you'll tell me?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Ask away.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	What are your parameters?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I was dispatched...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	To make sure that the two of you don't get what you want.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Exploit the blind spots.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And be a nuisance at every step.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	In other words...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	My goal was to inhibit operation arteria.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And yes...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Fero sent me, in particular, for a reason.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	He expected friction between you and Atlas.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Which I was to exploit.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	By turning you against Atlas.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	So when Atlas approached me, it was almost to good to be true.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	So simple...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And utterly profane.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	So I decided to spice things up a little.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Try and see what he's really like.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Yeah, he's definitely done a number on me.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But on the other hand...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	He told me about her.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Seeing as even you didn't know the details of what happened seven years ago...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Seeing as even you didn't know the details of what happened seven years ago...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	To tell you the truth...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	We didn't expect Atlas to be a turncoat.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	It was almost too good to be true.
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	How?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Oh and by the way...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Daphne	The sheer guts on you...
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	So how about it?
Sewers (Admin)_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	You want to become friends again?
Sewers (Admin)_Event5_Page2	Ganymede	It's the other way.
Cellar_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	It's the other way.
Cellar_Event2_Page1	Atlas	We should finish our business here, first.
Cellar_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Let's talk to him later.
Cellar_Event3_Page3	Atlas	No time to waste.
Cellar_Event3_Page4	Ganymede	I'd rather not go back in there.
Western Wing_Event2_Page1	Adrián Horvat	I don't know, man.
Western Wing_Event2_Page1	Adrián Horvat	Something about that is seriously fishy...
Western Wing_Event3_Page1	Jadran Tomić	Oh, come on!
Western Wing_Event3_Page1	Jadran Tomić	I know a guy working there.
Western Wing_Event3_Page1	Jadran Tomić	And I'm telling you, it's legit!
Western Wing_Event4_Page1	Atlas	No need to intrude.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	Sorry to keep the two of you waiting.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	He put up way more resistance than I thought.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	Don't worry about it.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	How is he?
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	Sleeping like a baby!
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	Good.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	There's one thing that worries me, though.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	What?
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	I checked for his keys...
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	But they were gone, already.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Daphne	Shit.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Daphne	Atlas?
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	You got your own set of keys with you?
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	Of course!
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	Good.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	Let's not waste any more time, then.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	You know your way through the sewers?
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	Yeah.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	I've taken that route a few times, before.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	Okay.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	I'll stay here and keep an eye on Drenem.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	Good luck to you!
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	Thanks.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Atlas	For everything.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	Don't worry about it.
Western Wing_Event4_Page3	Liliane Hendrick	I'm just doing my job!
Western Wing_Event4_Page4	Atlas	We've got no time to waste.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	What's wrong?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Nothing.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	You sure?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Okay.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Atlas...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Yeah?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Are you absolutely sure this'll work?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	What do you mean?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Holding onto something for that long...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	You know how they are.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	If you want me to go, instead...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'll do it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	That's no good.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Your boss wouldn't let you go.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Not for anything in the world.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	No.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	It's gotta be me.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'm sorry, Gany.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	If you want out...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I won't hold it against you.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Don't mock me, please.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I'd never forgive myself.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	And you know that.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I wish there was a way I could make it easier on you.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	You can, actually...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Tell me.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Well...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Give me a reason to hold out.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Make it worth it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'll try my best.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	That's not what I mean.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	At this point...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	You probably figured out how I work.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	And what drives me.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I fall in love with things.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Or people.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Because I want to make them mine.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I cannot resist it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	And I'll always be a victim to these feelings.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I've thought about it time and time again.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	But I always end up at the same conclusion.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Atlas...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I'll have to fall in love with you.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Gany...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I know.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	What do you want me to do?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	I was briefed on you, you know...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Not the full story, of course.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	But I know there was a girl.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	She was more important to you than anything else in the world.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	So tell me...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	What was she like?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And that's the gist of it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Okay.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	That explains a lot.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	But to be frank...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	I didn't expect you to have a side like this.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Sorry to burst your bubble.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But I'm only human, after all.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Don't worry about it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	I think it's adorable in some way.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	And I can definitely emphasize with it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	It'll do.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Is that a yes?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Yup.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	I'll try!
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	No promises, though.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	The moment shit hits the fan-
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You'll give them Fero.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	And if that doesn't help?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You'll tell them about Hermingrad.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Good.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	As for the other thing...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Sorry.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	But I insist.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Why do you care about her in the first place?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	If you were in my spot...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Wouldn't you want the same?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	That's different.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	I don't think so.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	As far as I can see it...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	It's what she does.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Maybe.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Or maybe you just want to keep things pretty...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Before you smash them to bits.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	You're really something else, Atlas.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	It's like you're incredibly clever...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	But also insurmountably stupid, at the same time.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Or "maybe" it's just me not seeing you straight.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	In any case.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	You're in it for the madness.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Whether you like it, or not.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	There's something special about being in control.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Right?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Hm.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	It's working?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Somewhat, yeah.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	But I think I'm getting there.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Okay.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	It's about time I got underway.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Yeah.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Me too.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Good luck.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Likewise.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Áron.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Speak for yourself.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But I for one don't give a shit about who you are.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Because the only thing I see in front of me...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Is a child.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Keep it coming.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Everywhere you go...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You need to be center of attention.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	A life directed towards submission.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But never the happy servant for very long.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And so you drag yourself from high to low...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Hoping to find something.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Or someone.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	To latch onto forever.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	It's your sickness.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And your addiction.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	If it weren't for someone pulling your strings...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You'd have no idea where to go.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Isn't that right?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Timo?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Bravo.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	I mean it.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Thanks!
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	For being honest with you?
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	You know what...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	One day I'll kill you.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Feel free to try.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But for now...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	It's mutual assured destruction.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Solid finish.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Alright.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	Let's do this.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Right.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	See you in a few.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page2	Ganymede	See you in a few.
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Man...
Sewers (Room)_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	What a day.
Sewers (Room)_Event4_Page1	Ganymede	It's the other way.
Sewers (Room)_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Nothing for us up there.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Any minute, now.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Rupert Sternlein	Why didn't you tell us?
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Because it doesn't matter.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	If Solka's dealt with...
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Ionia will be gone from this place in a few hours.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Rupert Sternlein	Are you sure about that?
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	One hundred percent.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Their colonel is on leave.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And no one's left to lead his troops into battle.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Rupert Sternlein	I do hope you're right.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Rupert Sternlein	What about your associates?
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	One of them's already compromised.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	The other one...
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Will hardly be able to do anything on her own.
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	In other words...
Sewers (Hudsman Corner)_Event2_Page2	Atlas	It's over.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Where have you been?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Lorna!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Happy to see you, too.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Don't change the subject.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Sorry.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Guess I'm not used to you giving a shit about me, anymore.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	How dare you!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	You know how much I care about you?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Is that why you're treating me like a child?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	If you'd stop behaving like one!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Hm.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	I don't see what's funny about that.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Actually, it's kinda sad.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	That, after all these years...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	You still can't let go.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Between us...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I think you're the one behaving immature.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Go ahead.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Slap me again.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	There's no need for that.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Come on.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I won't tell him, I promise!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Are you sure?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	You're so good at telling him all kind of things.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	What does it matter?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	It's not like you didn't have your chance.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Listen...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I don't expect you to be happy for me.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But please...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Stop tormenting yourself.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	And that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	I've put in a request for immediate transfer, this morning.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	It's finally come to that, hm?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	So?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Where am I going?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Not you.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Me.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Seriously?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Yeah.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Where to?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	CoExA.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Uhm?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Oh, come on.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I'm sorry.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	The Commissariat for External Affairs.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Does that mean...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	You're leaving EnKAD?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Yeah.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Why?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Because I have to.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	I'm not happy here, anymore.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Everything reminds me either of you...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Or Atlas.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	If my transfer goes through, I'll be spending most of my time abroad.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I don't get it.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	What's not to get about that?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I always thought you were the tough one.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But standing in front of me, right now...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Is a coward.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	If you say so.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	It doesn't change anything.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	To be honest, I didn't even plan to tell you.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	So I would appreciate if you kept it to yourself, for now.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	And that's the real issue, isn't it?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	All this fucking secrecy!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Lorna, please...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	I know your stance on this.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	And you know mine.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Soon enough...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	We won't have to deal with each other, anymore.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	We'll see about that.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Where are you going?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I'm sorry.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But I can't tell you.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Eurydice	Don't do this, please.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Sorry...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But I have to.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	Lorna?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Sorry, Eury.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	I didn't know you were home, already.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	I can imagine.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	So?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	Why are you here?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	There's a few things I need to get rid of.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	It won't take long, I promise.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	So that's how it is.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	Just cleaning up, hm?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Sorry.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	But it's in your interest, too.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	The sheer guts on you.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	If it wasn't for her...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Eurydice	I'd kill you just for that.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	If that makes you happy.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Go ahead.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	But I'm in a bit of a rush, you see.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	So if you really want to do it...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Do it now.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page2	Atlas	I thought as much.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Eurydice	If you think I'd let you touch anything in that room-
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Atlas	I'm sorry, but I have to.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Eurydice	Give me the list.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Eurydice	I'll do it.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Can I trust you?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Eurydice	You said it yourself.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Eurydice	My life is on the line, as well.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Alright.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Make sure to burn everything.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	Thank you.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	But as you might remember...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	I've done these kind of things before.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Right, sorry.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Feels like it's been ages since-
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	Listen Atlas.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	There's nothing for us to say to each other.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	Ever again.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Okay.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Atlas	Farewell, Eury.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	You too...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page4	Eurydice	Áron.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Where the hell have you been?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	You've heard the news?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Yeah.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	The sheer guts on you...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Showing yourself here.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	I had to.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	Don't you agree?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	So...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Are you proud of yourself?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	What do you mean by that?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	You've finally taken her from me.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	And now...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	You can't even give her back anymore.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	Eury...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Did you even realize...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	She loved you, damn it!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	And I trusted you, as well.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Answer me one thing, Atlas.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Was the entire thing your idea?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Did you think you could just run off with her?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Or did you just her as a footnote in your CV?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	What was it, Atlas?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	You know I cannot talk about that.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	How convenient!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	You've always been a tool.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	But the one time you make a choice...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	You get my little sister killed.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	I am sorry.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	Beyond all measure.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	Lorna was very dear to me.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	And that's what makes it really sting...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	You've got nothing else to say?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	There's a lot of things...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	But I don't think it's gonna change anything.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Atlas	The only reason why I'm here is because I owe it to you and her.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	You say that, but you can't even tell me truth.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Then again...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	It's all the same to you, isn't it?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	I always knew it.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Deep down, you don't care about anybody but yourself.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Lorna refused to believe it.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	And so she died for you.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Get out.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	And for your sake...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page5	Eurydice	Hope that the two of us never meet again.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Look who it is.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Atlas	You've heard the news?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Yeah.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	The sheer guts on you...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Showing yourself here.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Atlas	I had to.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Don't you agree?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	So...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Are you proud of yourself?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Atlas	What do you mean by that?
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	You've finally taken her from me.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	And now...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	You can't even give her back anymore.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Atlas	Eury...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Did you even realize...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	She loved you, damn it!
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	And I trusted you, as well.

Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Get out.
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	And for your sake...
Eurydice Home_Event3_Page6	Eurydice	Hope that the two of us never meet again.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	How about we skip that part and get to it?
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	IIB Officer	You don't make the rules here.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	True.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	But you are aware that you can't work me like this, right?
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	Whatever you say.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	So...
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	That girl you were travelling with.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	She's my associate.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	Indeed.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	However, you were not travelling in on official business, were you?
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I'm afraid that's classified.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	That's irrelevant.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	You are obligated to share with me all details of your itinerary.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Has this been cleared with my CO?
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Officer	That's none of your concern.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Alright.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Have it your way, then.
Lorna Shakeup_Event1_Page1	Atlas	But until I see something official, I can't share any details with you.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	I'm afraid that's impossible.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Why?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Aren't you his boss or something?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	You do understand the gravity of this situation, do you?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	Desertion is a crime handled by military courts.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	If it comes to light that he helped you in your attempt.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	He won't be the only one in trouble.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	What do you mean by that?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	Your sister knew about this operation.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	And as much as it pains me...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	There is substantial evidence proving that she was the one who leaked it.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Now hold on a minute.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Are you saying that she sold us out?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	It's only a theory.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	You can be sure that I will take a deep look into this matter.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	But first, we need to deal with the situation at hand.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Right.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	Did you tell anybody else about this?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I don't think so.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Wait...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I think I said something to Dorothy.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Sorry.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Daphne, I mean.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	I see.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	This is bad.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Is she gonna get in trouble because of that?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	Very likely.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Shit.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	There's got to be something we can do.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	There might be a way.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Yeah?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Hyperion	I really don't want to put this on you.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Well, you said it yourself.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	If we don't do anything...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	We're fucked.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	So go ahead...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Tell me.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Atlas	You're kidding me.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	I wish I was.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	But I'm afraid the situation is far too dire for that.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Atlas	What did you do to her?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	I merely explained to her the ramifications of this incident.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	On each and everyone of us.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Did you mention that the entire thing was your idea, too?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Of course I didn't.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	But if you want, I'll go and tell her right now.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	I'm sure the interrogators would love to get that out of her, as well.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Let me speak to her, then.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	You know that's impossible.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	I already took a huge risk coming here.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	There's no way I'll let you endanger everything.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Atlas	Always looking out for yourself, aren't you?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	It's for your sake, too.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	And Eury's.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	All of us are implied in a serious breach of protocol.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Some might even say...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Treason.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Which is ridiculous, of course.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	You were merely investigating a case of attempted desertion within the military.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	The person in question being a Corporal named Lorna Faragó, born on the 5th May, 1897.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	To confirm your suspicions, you accompanied said Corporal all the way to the checkpoint near the city of Calpoli.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Your investigation was interrupted by two officials of the military.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Obviously they were not aware of your intentions.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	So they apprehended both you and Lorna.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	In the course of being questioned...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Lorna revealed that she, in fact, intended to desert.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	So, even though the military acted too rashly...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	They are to be commended on their efforts of keeping their own troops in line.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	As a member of EnKAD, I am deeply troubled by the sheer audacity to abandon Ionia in such a cowardly fashion.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	However, I also personally believe that this incident can and should be used as an appeal to further consolidate the executive branches of Ionia.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Is that agreeable to you?
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Atlas...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	She is dead, no matter what.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	There's nothing either of us can do to change that.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	We took a chance...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	And we lost.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Lorna is willing to take the fall for us.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	And I know you would do the same for her.
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	So please, I implore you...
Lorna Shakeup_Event4_Page2	Hyperion	Don't let her sacrifice go in vain.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	See?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	I told you he'd show up.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	Orpheus.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	Atlas.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	Eury.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	I found your message.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	Good.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	And I'm glad you made it here.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	I'd rather you skip the bullshit.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	And explain yourself.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	Straight to the point, as always.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	But alright.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	I have a question for you.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	Did Hyperion ever tell you who leaked your trip to the military?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	I don't see what any of that has to do with it.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	And to be honest...
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	I think you're stalling.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	You really are something else...
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	It was me.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	Was it, now?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	Not on purpose, of course.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	In fact, I just found out a few weeks ago.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	And only because Orpheus here told me.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	When I read her letter of recommendation...
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	Two things struck me.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	One, her possible involvement in a false flag operation at the Fredrick Dam.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	And second, a note regarding a certain Lorna Faragó.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	What did it say?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	A 21-year-old girl, serving in the military.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	A trouble-maker.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	And a possible defector.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	What?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	It's curious, isn't it?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	But it didn't matter.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	Fero was very anxious about the thing with that dam.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	And since we knew EnKAD couldn't do that without the military...
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	We made a few inquiries.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	And told the military about Lorna, in return.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	We put her on the map.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	As such, I consider myself responsible for her death.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	Even though I didn't know she was Eury's sister...
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	I played my part.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	And so did I.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	I've written a lot of letters, just like this one.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	I should've known better.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Eurydice	But I trusted Hyperion.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	You have it with you?
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Orpheus	Yup.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	Let me see it.
Galson Alley 1925_Event9_Page1	Atlas	I'll kill him.
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page2	Milovan Nyitrai	What the fuck?
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page2	Milovan Nyitrai	Did you hear that?
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page2	Milovan Nyitrai	\nr<Kenneth Horvat>Yeah.
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page2	Milovan Nyitrai	\nr<Kenneth Horvat>Probably just a warning shot.
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page2	Milovan Nyitrai	\nr<Kenneth Horvat>Or not.

Cell (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Julius Gaston	More importantly...
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Julius Gaston	Are you guys out of your fucking minds!?
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	I guess we are.
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Damien Fyodorov	So you're gonna come with us, or what?
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Julius Gaston	...
Cell (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Julius Gaston	Help me get up, will ya?
Farblein Apartments_Event1_Page1	Kay Nyilas	Good day to you!
Farblein Apartments_Event2_Page2	Tillian	Need to take care of Tanner, first.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	Eury.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	Hey Tillian.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	It's been a minute.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	Life is full of surprises, isn't it?
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	How is he holding up?
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	Pretty alright, last time I checked.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	They really pulled a number on him, though.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	Yeah.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	You're here to see him?
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	Yup.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	Want me to come with you?
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	If you won't get in my way.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	Oh, don't worry.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	You know how incredibly tactful I am.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	That's precisely what worries me.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	Anyways...
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Tillian	Let's get it over with.
Farblein Apartments_Event4_Page1	Eurydice	After you.
Farblein Apartments_Event5_Page2	Tillian	Need to take care of Tanner, first.
Farblein Apartments_Event6_Page1	Lorna	Another one, really?
Farblein Apartments_Event6_Page1	Lorna	Well, time's a wasting!
Farblein Apartments_Event6_Page1	Atlas	Don't get your hopes up.
Farblein Apartments_Event6_Page2	Lorna	Whoops!
Farblein Apartments_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Stop right there!
Farblein Apartments_Event6_Page3	Atlas	There's nothing left for us to do here.
First floor_Event3_Page3	Eurydice	That went a lot better than expected.
First floor_Event3_Page3	Tillian	Let's see if he keeps his word.
First floor_Event3_Page4	Tillian	We're finished here.
Tanner Apartment_Event3_Page1	Lorna	Another one, really?
Tanner Apartment_Event3_Page1	Lorna	Well, time's a wasting!
Tanner Apartment_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Don't get your hopes up.
Tanner Apartment_Event3_Page2	Lorna	Whoops!
Tanner Apartment_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Stop right there!
Tanner Apartment_Event3_Page3	Atlas	There's nothing left for us to do here.
Tanner Apartment_Event4_Page3	Daphne	Mind if we come in?
Tanner Apartment_Event4_Page3	Tanner	You've got some guts showing yourself here.
Tanner Apartment_Event4_Page3	Tanner	Close the door behind you, will ya?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	How am I supposed to sell that to Laurits?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	It's up to you, really.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	Hm.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	I'm sure he'll understand that there's no other way.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	Everyone knows what the Ionians, are like, now.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	Can I ask you something?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	Sure.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	You set this up, didn't you?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	You need to be more specific than that.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	The Ionians, I mean.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	You knew they were coming here, all along.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	And you used them to drive us right into Amryn's arms.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	I'm afraid I can't comment on that.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	Of course.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	In any case...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	We can keep you and Faber in power.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	And we're prepared to offer general amnesty to everyone involved.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	But for that to happen...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	You need to cooperate with us.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Louis Tanner	And if I don't?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page1	Tillian Márton	You'll have a revolution on your hands.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	It was Solka, wasn't it?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	I'm afraid we can't disclose that.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	I should've known.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	Oh well, not like it matters anymore.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	You've spoken to her, then?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Yes.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	How is she?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Good, all things considered.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	She's very brave for her age.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	I see.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	How much has she told you?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	It's been a few years...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	So the details are a bit muddy.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	But I think you are aware that this won't dilute the plausibility of her testimony.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	Of course.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	I take it you'll use this to gain leverage on Faber, as well?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	He's the patron of the orphanage.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	There's no way he wasn't aware of it.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	Hmm..
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	So, out with it, then.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	What do you want me to do?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	It's pretty simple, really.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	From now on, we don't want any of your men bothering our agents, assets or any member affiliated with the TLF.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	You want them to turn a blind eye?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	As you said it.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Furthermore, the checkpont is to be reopened immediately and all patrols on the eastern river are to cease.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Daphne	Including the deployment of any defensive measures.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	How do you know about this?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Daphne	That's not important.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Daphne	What matters is that you'll comply.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	This will leave the city nigh on defenseless.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Whatever the case might be...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Can you agree to these terms?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	Not like I have a choice.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	I take it you will meet Faber later today?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	After his speech, yes.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	Don't worry, I won't breathe a word of this to him.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	It's in my best interest, as well.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	I'm glad you see it that way, too.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Alright.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Just for the sake of completeness...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Do we need to state what happens if you decide to go back on your word?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	That won't be necessary.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Tanner	I'm well aware of your methods.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Good.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	I think that concludes our negotiations.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Thank you for your cooperation.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	We'll be in touch.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page2	Atlas	Let's go.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page3	Tanner	You should go.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	I'm not sure I understand.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	You want me to plan those mines?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	Exactly.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	I fail to see how that serves your purpose.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	Because there is a war at hand.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	And if those waters are safe, you'll have the Ionian Navy right on your doorstep.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	I get that.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	What I don't understand is your angle.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	You've more or less won already.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	That remains to be seen.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	Well, whatever the case...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	I'm guessing Faber won't be against the idea, considering the circumstances.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	So you can consider it done.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	Good.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	There is more.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	What a surprise.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	I'll pay you another visit, later today.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	Are you insane?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	It's necessary, I'm afraid.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	One of my associates will be accompanying me.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	To what end?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	That we're on the same page.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	I don't get it.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	Contrary to what we've discussed here...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	We'll ask you to stop any deployment of the mines.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	Oh!
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	So it's like that, hm?
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	You're a double agent!
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	Whatever you might think.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	This conversation here...
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Atlas	Never took place.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	Wow.
Tanner Apartment_Event5_Page4	Tanner	You really are something else.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	In all things, I believe humans share a desire to speak their minds.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	And while it's true that each of us tries to be forgiving...
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	Certain things are better left unsaid.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	Regardless, there comes a time when a man has to open the gates...
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	And share with the world the things he has done.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	For that reason, I have written this letter not only to you, but to everyone.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	You may hate or despise me, that is well within your rights.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	In fact, I do share your sentiment.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	I am an abominable creature.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	Or maybe I am just pityable.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	That depends on the observer, I guess.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	But in the end, I hope that someone at least...
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	Will take to understand me a bit better.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	My name is Arnold Francesco Solka.
Solka Backroom_Event1_Page1	Unknown	And this is my confession.
Thwarton Fields_Event6_Page1	Unknown	READY!
Thwarton Fields_Event6_Page1	Unknown	AIM!
Thwarton Fields_Event6_Page2	Unknown	READY!
Thwarton Fields_Event6_Page2	Unknown	AIM!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Hey!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You had us scared there, for a bit.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	What happened?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You don't remember?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Only bits and pieces.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Think I slipped or something.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	After that, it's just a big blur.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	How did I get here?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Atlas.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You should have seen the look on his face!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Don't beat yourself up.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Some people enjoy playing hero, once in a while.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Is he out?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Yeah.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Having a chat with Mr. Mayor.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Okay.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Speaking of...
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I gotta get going, too.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Right.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Sorry to keep you away from that.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	No worries!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	It's your first time in Trachi, right?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	How about you tag along?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	And I'll give you a lay of the land while we're at it?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	If you don't mind, of course.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Sure!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	And thanks!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Great!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	There's a bunch of clothes in that drawer over there.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Unless you prefer to go out as is, of course.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	!
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Did you-?
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I had to.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You were drenched from top to bottom, after all.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Well, guess I can't hide anything from you, anymore.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	You should have never tried to, in the first place.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Anyways...
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I'll wait for you outside.
Bedroom Gany_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	...
Bedroom Gany_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	Let's see...
Bedroom Gany_Event2_Page3	Atlas	Looks like they left their clothes here.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page1	Daphne	Damn it.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page1	Daphne	There's got to be something.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Daph?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Atlas?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Sorry I'm late.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Yeah, about that...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Care to tell me where the fuck you've been?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	It's a long story.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	And we don't have a lot of time.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Right.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	So...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	What did he say?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	It's true.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Orpheus is here.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	The thing with Solka...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Was that him?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	According to Sternlein, yeah.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	They pressured him into suicide.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Damn.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	How's the situation at the OA?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	I wish I could tell you.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	But I spent the entire night working Gany.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I see.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	What did he tell you?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Not much.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	A few things about Fero.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	The usual tripe about how you're trying to backstab us.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Hm.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Oh, and one more thing.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Yeah?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	He met Orpheus, a few months ago, apparently.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	"Random chance".
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	That explains a lot.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	It's got to be him.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	You know...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	It's been a while since the two of us did something together.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Not like I had much of a choice.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	And I'm sorry about that.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	But if you're up for it...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	We'll pay De Bloom a visit.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	Huh? Why?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	I've got a few questions for him.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	About that Tillian guy he sent with us.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	And after we're done with him...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	We'll go and see Ganymede.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	To be honest...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	I was a bit worried that you've grown soft.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	But now that you've got me all worked up...
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	You better take responsibility.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Isn't that what I've been doing, the entire time?
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	You know how it is.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Daphne	It's the climax that counts!
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Right.
Bedroom Gany_Event6_Page2	Atlas	Let's go.
Bedroom Daphne_Event1_Page1	Daphne	Looking for something specific?
Bedroom Daphne_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Huh?
Bedroom Daphne_Event1_Page1	Daphne	I didn't expect you to be so interested in a girl's room.
Bedroom Daphne_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Sorry.
Bedroom Daphne_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Guess I took the wrong door.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Welcome back.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Atlas?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Daphne.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	How's your back?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Hurts like hell.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	They got the bullet out.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	One of your kidneys, though...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Let's just say I wouldn't rely on it, if I were you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Funny...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	I wanted to say the same thing about you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You brought this on yourself, you know.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Yeah.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	By trusting you, for starters.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	So?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	What's the verdict?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Well...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Eury is dead, thanks to you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	For the record...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	That one wasn't planned.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	If you say so.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	If she hadn't-
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You pulled that trigger, Daph.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And there's no way to ever take that back.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Look who's talking.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	That's exactly my point.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	So unless you want to become like me...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	You better start living with yourself.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Honestly, Atlas...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Cry me a fucking river.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	There'll be time for that, don't worry.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But first...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I've got to deal with you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Oh, I'm sorry.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Why don't you get the fuck on with it, then?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Ariadne and Ganymede.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	That was you, wasn't it?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Indirectly, yeah.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Congratulations.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Thanks.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	But I really didn't do that much.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	On the contrary.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Ganymede's already across the border.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Coupled with Icarus being KIA...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	That's three CoExA agents dead and one in custody.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Not a bad yield for three days.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Yeah.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I bet Hyperion will be very proud of you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	And you?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	A bit of a mixed bag.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	On one hand, I'd very much like to strangle you, right now.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But then again...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I won't need to worry about abusing you, ever again.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Adorable.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	A shame you've got to trade me in for Gany, so soon.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	We won't.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Huh?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Gany's staying.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Orpheus knows about this?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Yup.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	He's gonna let his own brother rot away in Ionia?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	If that's how you like to see it.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Wow.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	I always knew you were a sadistic piece of shit.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	But this takes the bloody cake!
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Don't misunderstand me.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	When I said I'd abuse you...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	I didn't mean emotionally.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Not like I wouldn't enjoy it, of course.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	But ultimately...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	Someone needs to keep a watch on our friend.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Ganymede's a plant, isn't he?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	That's right.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Why?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	To cover you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Atlas	And the story you'll tell them.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Alright.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page2	Daphne	Let's hear it.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Daphne	You're out of your mind if you think I'm helping you with that!
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	It's up to you, ultimately.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Daphne	But?
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	Hermingrad.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Daphne	Atlas...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Daphne	You promised!
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	As I said...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	No more qualms.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	You hurt me, Daph.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	And you broke my trust.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	So from now on...
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	You're nothing but a chess piece to me.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	I will use you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	And abuse you.
Bedroom Daphne_Event2_Page3	Atlas	Until there's nothing left of you but dust.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Atlas	You okay?
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Yeah.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Good.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Want to go first?
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Mhm.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Just...
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Ganymede	Give me a second.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Take your time.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Do yourself a favour.
Icarus Bedroom_Event1_Page2	Atlas	Don't rush it.
ATOPIA_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hm...
ATOPIA_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Where's mum and dad?
ATOPIA_Event1_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Was that the door?
ATOPIA_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Hm...
ATOPIA_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Something's different.
ATOPIA_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Huh?
ATOPIA_Event1_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	What's that noise?
ATOPIA_Event1_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	Come on.
ATOPIA_Event1_Page5	Timotej Stojanov	There you are.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Hello?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Someone there?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Show yourself already!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	It's okay.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	You're safe now.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	Who is it!?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page1	Timotej Stojanov	It's me, Gany.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	What are you waiting for?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	I know you're there.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	Here we go.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page2	Timotej Stojanov	...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Timotej Stojanov	Not this time.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Finally.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Yo!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	You there?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Sorry.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Trick question!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	But I'm glad you can hear me!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Shit...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	She's breaking through.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	I don't know how long I can keep this up.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	So I'll make this quick.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	It's important that we talk.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	And soon.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	So please, whatever happens...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page3	Ganymede	Don't leave, just yet.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Timotej Stojanov	Not this time.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Finally.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Yo!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	You there?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Sorry.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	That was a trick question.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	But I'm glad you can hear me!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Shit...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	She's already breaking through.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I don't know how long I can keep this up.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	So I'll make this quick.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It's important that we talk.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And since this is as good an opportunity as any...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I might just try and see if this works.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Alright, here we go!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Much better.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Okay, so here's the deal...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I bought us around two and a half minutes.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Enough for a little chat!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	When the music stops...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I'll probably wake up.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Until then, I'll answer your questions.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	So go ahead.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Ask away.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Alright.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Looks like we're out of time.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It was fun, though.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And I hope we can do it again!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Bit of an open question, isn't it?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And honestly, I think you're a better judge than me.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Right, right.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I don't have to pull that kind of shit with you, I forgot.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	After all, you can't harm me... right?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	There's a barrier between us.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Some might say I'm fiction.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Then again, what are you to me?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Hm, I've been wondering about that, too.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Probably a place I created.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Another level in an unending amount of layers.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It's a bit hard to comprehend, isn't it?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	That's why we like to put things into boxes, I guess.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Uhm...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	I guess so.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	No hard feelings, though.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	She's just playing her part.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	And I'm playing mine.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	It's funny, really.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Knowing you have no control about it...
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Can make things a lot more bearable.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Aww!
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Or we can just stare at each other until our time is up.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	But who am I kidding.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Maybe I'm just talking to myself, after all.
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	Really?
ATOPIA_Event2_Page4	Ganymede	You wanna leave, already?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page1	Andrej Kovalenko	A license for trading in wine apparently does not encompass sparkling types.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page1	Andrej Kovalenko	Would someone please end my misery?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event1_Page2	Andrej Kovalenko	You can't make this stuff up...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Good day to you!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	How may I help?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	I'd like to inquire about the status of a request me and my companions filed earlier.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Certainly!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Your name, if you'd be so kind?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Julius Gaston.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Let's see...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	There doesn't seem to be anything here.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	I'll be right back.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	I'm afraid there's no record of any requests under that name.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Are you sure that you were the one who filed it?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Absolutely.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Thank you for the effort, anyway.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Wait, please!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	It's a long shot...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	But I could check the archives, if you want.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	We've had a lot of commotion lately and might have put it there by accident.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	That would be very forthcoming, thank you.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	I'll be right back!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any sign of the request there, either...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	I'm very sorry!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	There's no need.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Thank you, once more, for your dedication.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Atlas	Have a nice day.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page1	Dajana Martínek	Y-you too!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event2_Page2	Dajana Martínek	Sorry I couldn't help you!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	Salutations, Mister!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	How can I help you?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	We've been told we'd need a visa to enter Trachi.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	Quite right!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	If you're not a citizen, that is!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	I just need each of you to fill out these forms here and here...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	Coupled with appendices 4 and 5.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	All thirteen pages?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	As you said it.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	Feel free to take a seat over there, if you want.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Nikoleta Kádár	Fifteen minutes later...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	"Were you ever convicted?" "What does the insignia of Trachi depict?" "Underscore the prime numbers in the following list." Is there a system to these questions, at all?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Apart from trying to provoke a killing spree, you mean?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	It's deliberate, isn't it?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	You saw the queue at the gates, didn't you?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	So they're trying to filtering people with this?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	And delay the others.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Why?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Beats me.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	If they shut the gates...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	They'd violate the treaty, right?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Correct.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	But we shouldn't jump to conclusions.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Let's focus on the task ahead.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Half an hour later...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Permission to speak.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	If you have to.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	As soon as we're inside the city...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I'll find the clerk responsible for this questionnaire.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And once I do...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I'll take his stupid forms and shove them so far up his bureaucratic b-
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	You've made your point.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	If they're so keen on cooperating, why pull a stunt like this?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Either way, musing on it won't help.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Atlas	Another fifteen minutes pass...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I feel personally violated.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And utterly exhausted, at that.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Hello again!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Atlas	There you go.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Wonderful!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Atlas	We're a bit short on time, I'm afraid...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Atlas	And would really appreciate if there are no further delays.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Apologies for the inconvenience.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Verification should only take a moment.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Sorry for the delay!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Mr. Angelov was it?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Right.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	Born on the 7th September, 1894 in Mavrochori?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Exactly.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page2	Nikoleta Kádár	I'm afraid there's a problem.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event3_Page3	Nikoleta Kádár	I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event5_Page1	Bohdan Kladivo	Move along, please.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event9_Page1	Andrej Kovalenko	Not only did I just lose half my stock's worth, I now also have to wait for my new license to be issued.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event9_Page1	Andrej Kovalenko	At this point, I might just as well throw myself into the Klem headfirst.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event9_Page2	Andrej Kovalenko	Here's to you, Trachi!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event9_Page2	Andrej Kovalenko	Another hopeful soul grinded to dust by your agonizing charm!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event11_Page1	Leontiy Kos	Listen...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event11_Page1	Leontiy Kos	Those are vital medical supplies!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event11_Page2	Leontiy Kos	It's not like I'm entering Trachi to trade syringes and bandaids...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event11_Page4	Vangel Székely	This is an outrage!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event11_Page4	Vangel Székely	I have been a citizen of this city for over 30 years and now you're telling me I can't get in because I'm missing a piece of paper!?
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event14_Page1	Rada Kovačević	There's nothing we can do really...
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event15_Page1	Martha Boyko	No, I won't calm down!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event16_Page1	Lera Lazarov	We've been waiting for at least half an hour already.
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event16_Page2	Lera Lazarov	This is ridiculous!
Custom's Office (Checkpoint)_Event17_Page1	Man	There's got to be a reasonable explanation for this, I'm sure.
Icarus Hallway_Event2_Page1	Ganymede	...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Since when?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	We've had our eyes on you for months.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Me sending that boy to Glundon's place...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	You planned for that to happen?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	Yup.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	I see.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	What about the hit on Faber's daughter?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	Our contact in the IIS told us about it, earlier today.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	So yeah...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	We knew it was going to happen.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Let me get this straight.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	A little girl is getting abducted...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	And you just stood by and watched?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	It was too good of an opportunity to pass up.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	And to be fair...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	It worked.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	There's no way Faber's gonna strike any deals with Ionia, anymore.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	From what we know, the trade went through.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	We saw Ionia's agent getting released, an hour ago.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	And your mayor should have his daughter back, any minute now.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	So no harm done, all in all.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Hm.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	Something wrong?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	It's kind of funny, really...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	I always thought that Ionia's methods were despicable.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Not that I have any right to judge, of course.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	But I thought that Amryn, at the very least...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	Wouldn't sink that low.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	It's a dog eat dog world, I'm afraid.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	Until a few years ago, Ionia outmaneuvered us at every turn.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	You know why?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	Because our leadership refused to match their moves.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	That's why we lost this city, three years ago.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	And now...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	We're trying to take it back.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	We have more than enough dirt on the IIS to turn this entire city against Ionia.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	But we need a voice.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	Someone who's willing to stand up and tell the world what they've done.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	You have no family, right?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	That's true.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	You know how they operate.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	They'll always find a weak spot.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	You've been on their payroll for years.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	And participated in god knows how many of their schemes.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	So if you really, really want this to stop...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Tillian Márton	You've got to act, now.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page1	Arnold Solka	What are you proposing?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	What kind of cancer?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Pancreatic.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	How long do they give you?
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	It's hard to say.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	But I probably won't live to see the end of the year.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	I'm sorry to hear that.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	It's quite alright.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Every life must come to an end.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	And as bad as it sounds...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	At least I have an idea of when it's going to happen for me.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	Very stoic of you.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	But I doubt you wanted to talk to me just to get pitied.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Right.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Now, I don't expect my condition to be a problem when it comes to arteria.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	On the contrary.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	I believe only a man who is about to die can speak the truth.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	So maybe...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	I might be able to do something for you.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	Go on.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Four years ago, one of your colleagues came to me.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	He told me about a false-flag attack on Fredrick Dam.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	The entire story was utter bogus, of course.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	And obviously a plant.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	However, if there was even the slightest possibility...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	A hint of a chance that it was really true.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	No one could possibly ignore it.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	I put one of my Lieutenants on it.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Heinrich Navrátil.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Who delegated it to Sergeant Louis Tanner.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	And he shared it with one of his friends in the administration.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Laurits Faber.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	He made a deal with Ionia.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Sergeant Tanner supplied them with uniforms and explosives from our armory.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	And they, in turn, would send a few of their unwanted to the dam.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	I was notified only a few hours beforehand.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	And immediately dispatched Lieutenant Navrátil.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	He tried to negotiate.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	But Sergeant Tanner opened fire.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	Fourteen people dead.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	The price of freedom.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	I've played my part in this.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	And I hate myself for what I've done.
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	So with the last few months I still have...
Solka Living Room_Event1_Page2	Arnold Solka	I want to do some good.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	Dude...
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	I can't see shit!
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	Just use your eyes, man.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	Funny guy.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Viktor Marinos	You guys mind keeping it down and focus on your stuff?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	Yo, Vic!
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	How about you come down here and say that again?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Viktor Marinos	How about you stop wasting time and get those things planted, already?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	Alright.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	I'm done.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	You need any help?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	Nah.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Gianis Ivanov	I'm good, too.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	Alright.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	Vic?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	You there?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Viktor Marinos	You guys done?
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	Yeah.
Laurel Bridge_Event15_Page1	Leonidas Antoniou	Let's get out of here.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Ganymede?
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Hm?
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Oh, hey!
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Are you alright?
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	As well as I can be.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Did it start, already?
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Yup.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Do you need help getting up?
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I'm good, thanks.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Just don't expect me to be any help, whatsoever.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Don't worry about it.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	That's what I'm here for, after all.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Thanks.
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	I appreciate it!
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	With that being said...
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Shall we go and see your brother, now?
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ganymede	Of course!
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	Great!
Archives_Event1_Page2	Ariadne	After me, if you'd be so kind.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You can't possibly imagine...
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	How much I'm going to enjoy this!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	At least you're honest about it.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Surprised?
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Not really.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But it's a nice change of pace.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Thank you.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I hope you won't mind if we jump right into it.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Sure!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Go ahead.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	I have a theory.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	About the way you work, I mean.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	And why no one knows anything about you.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	There's a little place in your mind.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Almost as old as you.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Everytime your bratty mouth gets you into trouble...
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You disappear inside.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	I'm flattered.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	But I don't think it's anything to write home about.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	You've got one of those, too, don't you?
Archives_Event3_Page1	Ganymede	Dotty?
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	We all do.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Some need a little nudge.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Others require a special key.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You see...
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	There's just way too much bullshit coming out of your mouth!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	So I can't trust anything you say.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Whoops!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Very sorry!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Hey!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	You okay, down there?
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Good!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Anyways...
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Where was I?
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Oh, right!
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Fortunately for me...
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	There's more than one way for a body to express itself.
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	So I'm just gonna keep going...
Archives_Event3_Page1	Daphne	Until I find out who you're really working for.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Wakey wakey!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Daph?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I missed you.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	How are you holding up?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I'm not sure what kind of answer you're expecting.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	But I'm alright, I guess.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Glad to hear it.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	So?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	What's on the menu?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Well, I'm happy you enjoyed the appetizer.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	And I think we're both ready for the main course.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Atlas?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Hello, Ganymede.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	How nice of you to join in on the fun!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Ouch...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	That one kinda hurt, you know.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Shut up!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Or what?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	For the record...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	I'm sorry.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Nice try!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	But that won't work anymore.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Come on Gany.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Look. At him.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Hello?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	What the fuck?!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Awww.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Is it getting too much for you?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Tell me.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Where is he?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Jesus fucking christ!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	How do you think I would know?!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Atlas	Answer!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I don't know!
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Three down...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	Seven to go.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	I hope you'll last through all of them.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Daphne	You know what comes after that, right?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Steady.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Breathe.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Did it work?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Good.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Funny.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Alright.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Sorry for putting you through this.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	But for some reason, I'm dragging you into this place with me.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	And I think you can understand...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	That I'd rather be here than there, right now.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	But let's forget about that for a moment, okay?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Because there's more important matters at hand.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I was about to ask if you enjoy seeing this kind of stuff.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	But to be honest, it's all the same to me.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	For all I know, you are either a god...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Or just a voice in my head.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	That, too, doesn't really matter.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Because you're there.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	And that means the world to me.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Alright.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Time for me to go back.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I wonder how many fingers they've left intact.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Man, that shit is going to hurt for months...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Then again, what's a few broken bones for an entire city?
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	And besides...
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	I think it's time for everyone to find out, anyway.
Archives_Event3_Page2	Ganymede	Including you, of course!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Wakey wakey!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Daph?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I missed you.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	How are you holding up?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I'm not sure what kind of answer you're expecting.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But I'm alright, I guess.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Glad to hear it.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	So?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	What's on the menu?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Well, I'm happy you enjoyed the appetizer.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	And I think we're both ready for the main course.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Atlas?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Hello, Ganymede.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	How nice of you to join in on the fun!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Ouch...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	That one actually hurt, you know.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Shut up!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Or what?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	For the record...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	I'm sorry.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Nice try!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	But that won't work anymore.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Come on Gany.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Look. At him.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Hello?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	!!!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	What the fuck?!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Awww.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	There you are!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Tell me.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Where is he?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Jesus fucking christ!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	How do you think I would know?!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Atlas	Answer.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I don't know!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	!!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Three down...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	Seven to go.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	I hope you'll last through all of them.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Daphne	You know what comes after that, right?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Steady.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Breathe.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And go!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	It worked?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Good stuff.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Funny.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Damn.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I was hoping I could buy us a bit more time.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Anyways, I'm sorry for putting you through this.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But for some weird reason, I seem to pull you into this place with me.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And I think you can understand...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	That I'd rather be here than there, right now.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But let's forget about that for a moment, okay?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	So tell me, what's on your mind?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Alright, I gotta go back.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But don't worry.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I think it's time for everyone to find out, anyway.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Including you, of course!
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Come on.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I don't know how many hours we've spent together, by now.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	And you know a lot more about me than I know about you.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	It's a shame, really.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I wish we could interact more.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	As I said...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	It's my safe haven.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	The place I call home.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Normally, I'd be alone here.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But for some reason you're with me.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Why, I wonder...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Yeah, they're really working me.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	These two are feared for a reason.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I'm sorry.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	But for now, we got to live with it.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	If everything goes right...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	The two of us will have a lot of time to talk.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Hmm...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I think you're right.
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	Really?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	You're already running out of topics?
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	In all seriousness, though...
Archives_Event3_Page3	Ganymede	I'm glad you're with me.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I was born on the 16th July, 1872.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	In a city called Trachia.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	During the Afrikean war, I served as a sergeant in the Hellenic 18th Infantry Regiment.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	When Ionia had to relinquish my hometown, I was forced to make a choice.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	Betray the people I've grown up with, or betray the ideals that made me the man I was.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I couldn't decide.
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	So in the end...
Archives_Event5_Page1	Ganymede	I lost both.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Dorothy?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Hm?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Oh, hey Lorna!
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Sorry about that.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I was so focussed on the sheets...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Don't worry about it!
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I didn't mean to startle you.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	It's no problem.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	So, what brings you here?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	To be honest...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I don't know.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Huh?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	The thing is...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I kind of want to talk to someone.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But it feels like no one's really listening to me.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I think I get what you mean.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Want me to give it a shot?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I was hoping you'd ask.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But you've got to promise me something, first.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Yeah?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	No matter what happens...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	You can't tell anybody else about this.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Especially not Atlas, or Eury.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	It's that serious?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Yeah.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Alright.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	You got my word.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Thank you.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I had an argument with my sis, like an hour ago.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	What about?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	The usual.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	"Don't do this..." "Stop doing that." Basically...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Everything I do is wrong.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I'm sure she doesn't mean it in a bad way.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Yeah, I get that.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	And I appreciate her trying to protect me.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Honestly, I've kind of gotten used to it.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But ever since the thing happened between me and Atlas...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	It feels like she's actively looking for reasons to get angry at me.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	That hardly sounds like her.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Yeah.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	There's no denying that she's changed a lot, lately.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	She was always very fond of him.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But now, the two of them hardly speak anymore.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Hm.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	So I'm thinking she's jealous.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But every time I suggest anything in that direction...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	It's like I've flicked a switch.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	I see...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	It sounds tricky.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Yeah.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Don't get me wrong...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	We've always argued a lot.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But today...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Was something else.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I don't think I can ever go back to her.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Please don't say that.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	Family is important, you know.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	And I'm sure if you give it a bit of time, everything will be alright.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Maybe.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But what happens afterwards?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	There's no telling how the next argument is gonna go.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Like, I thought about this a lot.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	And there's only one way to resolve this.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Daphne	What?
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I'm going to run away.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	And leave everything behind.
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Not only because of Eury...
EnKaD Barracks_Event2_Page1	Lorna Faragó	But because I hate it here.
Hallway_Event1_Page2	Atlas	We're done with him.
Hallway_Event1_Page2	Drenem Hendrick	I should go and see Lily.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Wait.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Hm?
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	There's something I got to ask you.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Go ahead.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	What De Bloom said about you and Eury...
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Is it true?
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Yeah.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	I found her.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Why did you never mention it?
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	I told you that I'd protect her.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Even if she's a traitor?
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	You know I don't really care about that.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Let's try another angle, then.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	What if she's responsible for the Lorna thing?
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	I'll kill her.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Can't say I agree with your motives.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	But alright.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Anything else?
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Nope. I'm good.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Okay.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Atlas	Let's go and see Gany.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	Right.
Hallway_Event4_Page1	Daphne	He's in the archives, down in the basement.
Hallway_Event7_Page1	Marinos Floros	To be fair, though, it's gotta be pretty rough on him.
Hallway_Event7_Page1	Marinos Floros	Especially with the Ionians breathing down his neck.
Hallway_Event15_Page1	Marinos Floros	Yeah, he flipped his shit at me, too.
Hallway_Event15_Page1	Marinos Floros	Like it's our fault that these guys didn't know how to file their stuff.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Hey Lily.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, hello dear!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	How nice of you to come and visit me.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's the least I can do.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	And I'm sorry I had put this on you, so suddenly.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Don't worry about it!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I like a bit of an adventure, here and there.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	And look, I even brought the Chario with me!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Really, Lily?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'm sorry!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	But you said yourself that we don't know when we'll be back.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	And as you know, I hate letting things go to waste.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Right.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	So how about it?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Want to share a glass?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm sorry...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But I'm technically at work still.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, come on!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Like that has ever stopped you, before.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Please, Lily.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	It's really important that I keep a clear head, today.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Oh?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	For what?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	There's something I need to take care of.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Alright.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Guess some things never change, hm.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Don't do this to me, please.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'll be back in a few hours at most.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	And once I'm back...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	We can go home again.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Already?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	We've only been here for a few hours.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Well, if you want to stay a bit longer, that's fine too, of course.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But I'd rather be back in my own place, if that makes sense.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Sure, I can understand that.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I know how much you love the house, after all!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Yeah.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Anyways, I'll come and see you as soon as I'm back.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	If you need anything in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call on the room service.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Sure.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'll try to leave some of that Chario for you.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Very kind of you.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But you don't need to hold back on my account.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Oh, please!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	It's not like I don't have any self control, you know.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	And besides...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I've got an entire plate of pralines to pass the time with.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Oh?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Are these from the Alpeaux?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I think so, yeah.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	The room service brought them in, earlier.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	They were addressed to you...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	But you know how weak I am when it comes to stuff like that!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Don't worry about it.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I did manage to save these, though.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Since I know how much you love them!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Want to take some with you?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Thank you, but I haven't even eaten lunch, yet.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	You're unbelievable.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I'm sorry.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But you know how my appetite is.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Alright.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Off you go, then.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Lily, please.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Sorry.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	But I've been thinking a lot, lately.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	About what?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	About us.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	And our marriage.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I think I know where this is going.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You've been very very patient with me, all these years.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	And I can more than understand if it's too much for you.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	But please...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Give me a few more hours, and I'll explain everything.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	You've said those words to me, before.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	And frankly...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'm not sure I can trust them, anymore.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You can, I promise.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Next time we see each other, everything will become clear.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	If it doesn't...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	You won't get any more arguments from me.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Alright.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I'll take your word on that.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Yeah.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	In any case, I'll get going, now.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Okay.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Oh, and just in case...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I think I'll take you up on your offer, after all.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Glad to hear it!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Which one, though?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Come on, Lily.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Sorry!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I just wanted to cheer you up.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	But here...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Maybe these will do!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Mhh...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Exceptional.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	I know, right!
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Truly...
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Except-
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Hm?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Everything alright?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Yeah.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Guess I'm even more tired than I thought.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	You do look a bit pale.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Want to lie down?
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	I can't.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	Just a few more hours.
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Drenem Hendrick	We're almost th-
Lily Room_Event2_Page1	Liliane Hendrick	Drenem?
Stuart Apartments_Event3_Page1	Aleš Boyanov	What's up?
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page1	Miloje Viktorov	Have a nice day!
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Tillian	What's up?
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Daphne	Tillian!
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Daphne	Did they demote you to receptionist now?
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Tillian	Suits me a lot better doesn't it?
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Daphne	It really does!
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Daphne	How about you go and tell your old friends from Nestville all about that?
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Tillian	Right.
Stuart Apartments_Event5_Page2	Tillian	I'll see myself out, then.
Stuart Apartments_Event6_Page2	Jordan Martínek	Hey Tillian.
Stuart Apartments_Event7_Page1	Kuzman Hájek	Keep your chin up.
Stuart Apartments_Event10_Page1	Jordan Martínek	Hey.
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	What are you waiting for?
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Tillian	I gotta ask you something.
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	Sure.
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	I'm all ears.
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Tillian	Why are you doing this?
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	Helping Gregor, you mean?
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Tillian	Yup.
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	It's quite simple, really.
Staircase_Event1_Page2	Eurydice	Revenge.
Staircase_Event1_Page3	Daphne	This is it, hm.
Staircase_Event1_Page3	Daphne	You ready?
Staircase_Event1_Page4	Daphne	You ready?
Staircase_Event2_Page1	Costas Andonov	You okay?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	How's the situation?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	A couple of wounded, five people dead, at least.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Who fired the first shot?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	No one's owned up to it, yet.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	But a lot of people are saying it was the militia.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Hm.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	What do you think?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	If I had to put my money on someone...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	I'd say it was that girl from the IIS.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Probably, yeah.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	We need to make sure something like that doesn't happen again.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	Right.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	How many men do they have in Rondham?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	Doubt it's much more than thirty of fourty.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	But they have Heinrich with them.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	He could be a problem, yeah.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Which is why we need Tanner on our side.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	How is he?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Suffered a few minor injuries...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But he'll manage.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	Is he ready to talk to the mayor?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I hope so.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	Want me to check up on him?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	If you don't mind.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	He's in his apartment in Farblein Trail.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	Alright.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	I'll be back in a bit.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	One more thing.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	What?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I've asked Eury to keep a watch on him.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	No offense...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	But do you really think this is a good idea?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	I'm not sure if we can trust her.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Neither am I.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But she's proven very reliable, so far.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	If it wasn't for her leaking all that info on arteria...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Ionia would have already gotten to us.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	If you say so...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	I appreciate your vigilance, Tillian.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	But you have to understand that Eury doesn't have anywhere else to go.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	The only thing waiting for her in Ionia is a firing squad.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	So I doubt she'll try anything funny.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	Alright.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	You're the boss.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Tillian	See you in a few, then.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page1	Gregor Lorentz	Right.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page2	Gregor Lorentz	Keep your head straight.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	It's starting?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Tillian	Yep.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	Everyone in position?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Tillian	As far as I saw it.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	What about the militia?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Tillian	Arrived ten minutes ago.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	Good.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	Enter.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	Eury.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Eurydice	They're here.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	Perfect.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	Come on, Atlas.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page3	Orpheus	What are you waiting for?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	Atlas.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Atlas	Orpheus.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	Eury.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Eurydice	Daph.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	Now that we're all here.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	Let's talk terms.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	You think so?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	I was rather hoping you'd put up more of a fight.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	Sorry to disappoint you.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	But there's no need for me to resist.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	You've got my brother, don't you?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	What's left of him, anyway.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	I figured as much.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Orpheus	So... What do you want?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	Well, for starters...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	You're gonna come with us.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	We'll haul both of you back to Ionia.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	And then, we'll squeeze every little detail out of you, your precious little brother...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	And that bitch of yours.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Eurydice	Oh my.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Eurydice	So confident.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Eurydice	Reminds me of myself when I was your age.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	With one key difference...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Daphne	I never lost.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Eurydice	Really?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page4	Eurydice	Are you sure about that?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Orpheus	I see.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Orpheus	That is... disappointing.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Orpheus	But it doesn't change anything.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	That's right.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	You'll join him, soon, anyway.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Orpheus	I don't think so.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	Really?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	And why would that be?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Orpheus	You still grasped it?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Orpheus	You're outnumbered.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	I can count well enough, thank you very much.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Atlas	Put it down, Daph.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	Atlas?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Atlas	Sorry.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Atlas	But I mean it.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	This isn't funny.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Atlas	It isn't.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Atlas	Drop it, now!
Goose Shed_Event1_Page5	Daphne	Why?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	He set it all up.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	From start to finish.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Every piece of the puzzle, right there...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Apart from one thing.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	How did Hyperion know that Lorna wanted to run away?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	I had no clue.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	And neither did Eury.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Lorna never told any of us.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Did she?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Hm.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	You got me right there.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	It's weird isn't it?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	She made me promise not to tell either of you.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	You know why?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Because as much as both of you loved her...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	You never really listened to anything she said.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Of all the people in the world...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	I was the only one who knew what she was going through.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	And yeah.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	I told Hyperion.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	What did you tell him?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	That Lorna wanted to get away from it all.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	And what did he say?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	"I'm sure we can find a way to fix all this."
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Daph.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	You know the story, now.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	The sides are set.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	And the masks are dropped.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	I'll give you a choice.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Join us, and we'll make him pay.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Atlas.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	I meant what I said.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	There's no one on this world I love more than you.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	You saved me from a monster.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	But Hyperion picked me up.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	He showed me something I'm good at.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	And I'm not willing to give that up for a person who's been dead for more than four years.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Alright.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Then leave.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	What?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Go and tell Hyperion...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	I'm coming for him.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Are you having a laugh?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	There's no way I'll let the three of you off, like that.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	You're welcome to try.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	But I'd rather not waste any time, if I were you.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Oh?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	And why would that be?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	You never read Solka's letter, did you?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Should I?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	I don't think there's any need for that.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Not for you, at least.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	But for everyone who doesn't know...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	I'm sure they'll appreciate all the details behind what happened, back then.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	What?!
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	You heard me.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	It's public knowledge, now.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Are you insane?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	If Amryn gets wind of that-
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	They'll declare war on Ionia.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	You'd go this far, just for her?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Eurydice	She was right, you know.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Eurydice	Ionia is a monstrosity.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	As if Amryn were any better.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Who said anything about Amryn?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Huh?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Who's paying your bills then?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Orpheus	No one.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Orpheus	You said it yourself.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Orpheus	People like us can't help ourselves.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Orpheus	Just like this city...
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Orpheus	We want to be free.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	This just gets better and better.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	You think you can cause a war and get away with it?
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	The entire IIS will be up your arse in a week!
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	We'll see about that.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Just keep in mind that we have a list.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	And your name's on it, too.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Now that's more like it.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Alright, let's have it your way.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Sorry, Daph.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	It's nothing personal.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Right.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	I'll remind you of that when I come back and put this city to the torch.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Feel free to.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Atlas	Not today, though.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Yeah.
Goose Shed_Event1_Page6	Daphne	Not today.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Daphne	Damn.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Daphne	I missed...
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	Eury!
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Orpheus	I'll go and fetch a doctor!
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	Don't bother.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	I think I'm done for, anyway.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	Don't say that.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	I refuse to let you go.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	It's a bit late for that, isn't it?
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	But I do appreciate the sentiment.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	Stop the melodramatic bullshit, already!
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	You'll live, you hear me?!
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	Thank you for everything, the two of you.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	And don't worry about me, too much.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	After all these years...
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Eurydice	I can finally apologize to her.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Orpheus	Atlas!
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Orpheus	Don't.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Orpheus	We'll need her.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	You're right.
Goose Shed_Event13_Page1	Atlas	Don't wait for me.
Dotty Bedroom_Event2_Page1	Dorothy Preston	Daddy?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Shit!
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	What's wrong?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Did you see my pants anywhere?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Seriously?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	This isn't funny, you know.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I gotta be at the barracks in thirty minutes.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Did you have a look under the bed, yet?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Of course I di-
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Actually...
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Phew.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	See?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Hm.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	This is bad.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	What?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	My service card's not in here.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Hm.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	You think you left it at home?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Probably, yeah.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	You know if Eury is back in Aion?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I'm not sure.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	But I think so, yeah.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Fuck.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	I'd rather not run across her, right now.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Did you have another argument?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Right before she left, yeah.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	I see.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Atlas	Want me to go and fetch your stuff for you?
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Nah, it's fine.
Atlas Home_Event1_Page1	Lorna Faragó	Seeing you might just rile her up even more.
Eastern Hallway_Event7_Page1	Dalibor Sobol	He's all yours.
Eastern Hallway_Event8_Page1	Dalibor Sobol	The door is open.
