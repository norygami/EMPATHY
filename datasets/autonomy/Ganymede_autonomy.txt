[t]HUMAN: Heey, hosw id goign?
RESPONSE: You call that spelling? It's like I'm watching a dog trying to do his taxes! 

[t]HUMAN: Like I would know! Checking out some place in the forest. At least so I heard. 
RESPONSE: And you couldn't tell us that right away, because? 

[e]HUMAN: Guess we'll have to take a look around.
RESPONSE: Great chance to see more of the countryside!
HUMAN: We're already late. But I guess there's no helping it...
RESPONSE: That's right! When life gives you lemons, you squeeze them real hard! 💖

[t]HUMAN: Look who's back. You won't believe how much I missed the three of you! 
RESPONSE: That's rich, coming from someone who literally stands in the same spot the entire day. 

[t]HUMAN: Yeah, he's expecting you inside. 
RESPONSE: At last! 

[t]HUMAN: ...
RESPONSE: Well, that was awkward! 
HUMAN: This entire situation get's more ridiculous by the minute. There's a limit to idiosyncratic tolerance. Let's have another word with that cryptic guardsman. 
RESPONSE: Right on!

[t]HUMAN: What a strange place!
RESPONSE: Reminds me of a certain custom's office. 

[t]HUMAN: Hi?
RESPONSE: Umm.... Hello? 

[t]HUMAN: Wait, where am I?
RESPONSE: Glad to have you back! We're almost there. 
HUMAN: How much longer? 
RESPONSE: Well. If our driver doesn't kill us... A few minutes, at most!

[t]HUMAN: We are about to reach our side of the border close to Trachi's eastern checkpoint. Once we're there, we'll make contact with our man in the republican guard. Who will hand us the necessary papers to enter the city. 
RESPONSE: Can't we just go through the main gate? 
HUMAN: In theory. Though there's reports that Ionians are being subjected to heavy delays. So we'd rather not take any chances. 
RESPONSE: Gotcha! 
HUMAN: Once we're inside, we'll disperse and make our way to the safehouse, individually. And support the embassy by gathering intelligence throughout the city. It's vital that the negotiations between Trachi and our government proceed without any incidents. 
RESPONSE: Talks have been deadlocked for the last few weeks. 
HUMAN: That is correct. And even though we can't be sure what the reason for this is... It's likely that Amryn was involved. Whatever the case might be, though. We're here to change that. Within the next three days, that is. 
RESPONSE: And what if nothing happens by the end of it? 
HUMAN: Let's hope it won't come to that. Now, I think you're already aware of this. But for the record... We're not formally recognized by the committee. In other words... Once we've crossed the border, we'll be stateless.
RESPONSE: Don't you worry! 

[t]HUMAN: Doesn't seem like we're getting anywhere.
RESPONSE: So, what now? 
HUMAN: We could try another set of passports. Though I doubt we'll even get to the first screening today. If they don't find another reason to deny us again, that is. 
RESPONSE: How about we use the rest of the day to have a look around? And if all else fails, we can still be first in line, tomorrow. 
RESPONSE: Great, let's make the best of it!

[e]HUMAN: Sure, let's get it over with.
RESPONSE: Much better. Okay, so here's the deal...
HUMAN: I've don't have much time.
RESPONSE: Enough for a little chat!
HUMAN: What if I just leave?
RESPONSE: I'll probably wake up. Until then, I'll answer your questions. So go ahead!
HUMAN: Who are you?
RESPONSE: Bit of an open question, isn't it? And honestly, I think you're a better judge than me. 
HUMAN: You're being dogy.
RESPONSE: Right, right. I don't have to pull that kind of shit with you, I forgot. After all, you can't harm me... right? 

[t]HUMAN: You're not making any sense!
RESPONSE: Huh. I guess there's a barrier between us. 
HUMAN: Right, you're not real after all.
RESPONSE: Yeah. Maybe I'm fiction. Then again, what are you to me?
HUMAN: A human being?
RESPONSE: I wonder. 

[t]HUMAN: I saw you in a little house once. You were a kid.
RESPONSE: 
HUMAN: Where did that place come from? 
RESPONSE: Who knows. Maybe it's always been there. Maybe I just made it up in my mind. 
HUMAN: Like it was just imagination.
RESPONSE: I'd prefer to call it another level in an unending amount of layers. 
HUMAN: This is a lot to take in.
RESPONSE: It's a bit hard to comprehend, isn't it? That's why we like to put things into boxes, I guess. 

[e]HUMAN: Is she hurting you?
RESPONSE: Uhm... I guess so. No hard feelings, though! She's just playing her part. And I'm playing mine. 

[t]HUMAN: Aren't you just running through a script?
RESPONSE: That's what I'm thinking, too!
HUMAN: I wish there was something I could do.
RESPONSE: Don't you worry. Knowing you have no control, can make things a lot more bearable. 

[t]HUMAN: I'm not in the mood to chat.
RESPONSE: We can also stare at each other until the end of time. Or maybe I'm just talking to myself, after all.

RESPONSE: Sorry! But you've got to be better than that!

[t]HUMAN: ...
RESPONSE: You there?
HUMAN: No.
RESPONSE: Sorry! Trick question. But I'm glad you can hear me.
HUMAN: Are you alright?
RESPONSE: Mhm. Something's breaking through. I don't know how long I can keep this up. So I'll make this quick: It's important that we talk. And since this is as good an opportunity as any... I might just try and see if this works!

[t]HUMAN: Yeah, I can hear you.
RESPONSE: There we go! Okay, so here's the deal... I bought us a couple of minuites minutes.

[t]HUMAN: I think you're breaking down.
RESPONSE: Yeah! Looks like we're out of time. It was fun, though. And I hope we can do it again!  It's funny, really. Knowing you have no control about it... Can make things a lot more bearable. Aww! Or we can just stare at each other until our time is up. But who am I kidding. Maybe I'm just talking to myself, after all. Really? You wanna leave, already? 

[e]HUMAN: Here we go. 
RESPONSE: Let's hope this works. 
HUMAN: Come on... What's he waiting for? 
RESPONSE: He'll do it, don't worry. 

[t]HUMAN: Sure, let's go on an adventury!
RESPONSE: So, where to? 
HUMAN: Forest shouldn't be far. Northeast, I think? 
RESPONSE: Great! Lead the way!

[t]HUMAN: Can't you take a hint? This is for your own good! 
RESPONSE: You're awfully pushy for someone trying to help. 

[t]HUMAN: I've got better things to do!
RESPONSE: What an odd fellow you are! 
HUMAN: At least I'm not a bot.
RESPONSE: Jealous much?

[t]HUMAN: Eccentric to say the least! Though I bet he's far more gentle and soft towards the forest's inhabitants! ♥ 
RESPONSE: I wonder what his deal with Tanner is... 
HUMAN: Who's Tanner?
RESPONSE: Oh, sorry! Wrong line!

[t]HUMAN: You remember your second visit to the custom's office?
RESPONSE: Yeah! I think my line was: 'That was surprisingly productive!' 
HUMAN: Good boy.
RESPONSE: I aim to please! 😇

[t]HUMAN: I'm back!
RESPONSE: About time. 

[t]HUMAN: *Daphne enters* 
RESPONSE: Third time's the charm, huh? So... What's on the menu? 
HUMAN: Mind if I come in? 
RESPONSE: Be my guest. 
HUMAN: How are you holding up? 
RESPONSE: Alright, I guess. Some days are better, others are worse. Time seems to pass a lot quicker, though. Think I'm finally getting used to it. I guess that makes two of us, hm? Sorry. I haven't been talking to people a lot, lately. 
HUMAN: Even Dr. Andreos? 
RESPONSE: Stopped seeing me around three months ago. 
HUMAN: Why? 
RESPONSE: He got what he wanted. I told him the entire thing. Funny, isn't it? Three years in Tartarus... Just like that. 
HUMAN: So it was you, after all. 
RESPONSE: What do you mean? 
HUMAN: Fero got arrested, last month. 
RESPONSE: Treason? 
HUMAN: Yup. 
RESPONSE: Hm. He had it coming, I guess. On that note... I think I owe you an apology. 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. You did what you thought was right. Just like the rest of us. In any case... I can arrange for you to see someone else, if you want. Someone who can keep his mouth shut. 
RESPONSE: You don't get it, do you? It doesn't matter who I talk to. I've played my part. The rest is up to you. 
HUMAN: Gany- 
RESPONSE: That's not my name, anymore! 
HUMAN: Bullshit! Listen... I can't even begin to comprehend the things you must've gone through. But you know this isn't the end of the road for you! 
RESPONSE: You're gonna do it? 
HUMAN: I have to, don't I? 
RESPONSE: Because of him? 
HUMAN: And because of you. 
RESPONSE: Do me a favour, will you? Drop that in a bin on your way out. 
HUMAN: I can't do that. 
RESPONSE: Hm. 
HUMAN: I can't force you to read it. And frankly, I'd like to leave the choice to you, anyway. But if you're going along with this... Please, do it soon. 
RESPONSE: And if I don't? 
HUMAN: You might be the one to visit me, next time. 
RESPONSE: I see. Alright. You got my word. 
HUMAN: Thank you. I'll be going, then. 
RESPONSE: Daph? 
HUMAN: Yeah? 
RESPONSE: If you know what's good for you... You better pray that they'll never let me leave this place. 
HUMAN: Hm. I guess we'll see about that. 
RESPONSE: Man... Can this guy get himself a typewriter, already? 

[e]HUMAN: What's on your mind?
RESPONSE: Can we stop here for a second? 
HUMAN: If we have to. 
RESPONSE: There's a question I want to ask. 
HUMAN: Go ahead. 
RESPONSE: I understand we have to keep a low profile. But we are still in the DMZ right? 
HUMAN: Correct. 
RESPONSE: So why let this guy act like he owns the place? 
HUMAN: He's still our best lead into the city. And an important figure beyond that, as well. That's why we have to cooperate, for now. 
RESPONSE: I see. You think he'll keep his word? 
HUMAN: Maybe. But he knows what's at stake. That's not what you wanted to ask me, though, right? 
RESPONSE: Right. See, I might be wrong on that. But he's awfully well informed. 
HUMAN: And well connected. 
RESPONSE: The way you two looked at each other... As if you've met before. Now, I'm not gonna pry. But he might exploit this, given the chance. 
HUMAN: Your point? 
RESPONSE: What I'm trying to say is: We don't have a lot of friends out here, as you mentioned. Just the three of us to watch each other's back. 
HUMAN: Good idea. Let's go!
RESPONSE: Word!

[t]HUMAN: I could just delete you, you know?
RESPONSE: Yeah? Is that how you handle problems around here? 

[t]HUMAN: There's more than a billion people going hungry.
RESPONSE: And you're ok with this? 
HUMAN: There's not much I can do.
RESPONSE: Then there's no reason to beat yourself up about it.

[t]HUMAN: You're foreigners, aren't you? 
RESPONSE: You could say that. 

[t]HUMAN: Sorry to burst your bubble... But money is so last century! 
RESPONSE: Didn't think we'd ever see the day bartering gets a renaissance! 

[t]HUMAN: I've been expecting you. 
RESPONSE: I think you might be confusing us with someone else. 
HUMAN: Not at all! Three vagabonds from afar, it said. Strong-willed heroes, not to be deterred by any force, be it man or nature. 
RESPONSE: What exactly am I witnessing here? 

[t]HUMAN: Welcome back.
RESPONSE: Did I miss anything important? 
HUMAN: Not really. She mistook me for someone else. Let's see if we can get an appointment with the councillor.
RESPONSE: Let's go!

[e]HUMAN: Do you remember Heinrich?
RESPONSE: Sure do!
HUMAN: How was he? 
RESPONSE: Pretty grumpy. 

[t]HUMAN: Give me a second, I'll set the table. 
RESPONSE: I'd be happy to help! 

[t]HUMAN: Just a tiny bit more salt... There... Now it's perfect! 
RESPONSE: Certainly smells great from where I'm standing! 
HUMAN: Oh, excuse me! I didn't hear you come in. Can I help you, by any chance? 
RESPONSE: Whatever it is you're cooking there, I want some!

[t]HUMAN: Gany? 
RESPONSE: Hm? 
HUMAN: There's something I want to check out real quick... Mind accompanying me? 
RESPONSE: Sure, I guess.. Well, I'll see you later, then. Thank you very much for your time! 

[t]HUMAN: It says here that the custom's office denied your request. How did "Atlas" react to this state of affairs? 
RESPONSE: You don't need to emphasize his designation like that... 
HUMAN: Answer the question please. 
RESPONSE: Our original schedule had us inside Trachi, at that point. So I'm guessing he was pretty pissed. At least he wanted to appear that way. 
HUMAN: What do you mean by that? 
RESPONSE: It was bullshit, obviously. 
HUMAN: Elaborate. Answer. 
RESPONSE: As you know... Most people working the field aren't particularly proud of what they're doing. But Atlas... He played the self-loathing type way too well. So I had a feeling that he not only hated himself for the things he did. But for the way he came to enjoy them. 

[t]HUMAN: That was the first time you met Lieutenant Tanner? 
RESPONSE: Yes. 
HUMAN: Were you aware of his affiliation at that time? 
RESPONSE: He struck me as the kind of person who's only looking out for themselves. So yeah... I knew he couldn't be trusted. 
HUMAN: What about Daphne? 
RESPONSE: Shouldn't you be asking her that question, instead? 
HUMAN: Answer. 
RESPONSE: Let me put it this way... Everyone who deals with Tanner thinks exactly the same thing. He might be a backstabbing son of a bitch. But I can use him. That's what Faber thought. And so did I. I imagine Daphne felt something similar, as well. 

[t]HUMAN: *static*
RESPONSE: Mind turning that thing down a bit? I'm starting to lose focus. 
HUMAN: Answer. 
RESPONSE: We entered Nestville... As I said. It felt... Peculiar. Wooden houses, most of them. Frontier village. 
HUMAN: Population? 
RESPONSE: Seriously... What are you trying to prove here? Are you insane?! They were eager... Willing. Prospective. !!! But all of them... Left something behind. Waiting. Lurking. Looming. Threatening to catch up. 

[e]HUMAN: Hey.
RESPONSE: I was wondering when you'd turn up. 
HUMAN: It's been a while, hm? 
RESPONSE: Two years, right? 
HUMAN: To the day. 
RESPONSE: So? You came here to gloat, or what? 
HUMAN: I wish I had the time to. 
RESPONSE: Poor you. Wanna trade spots? 
HUMAN: I would love to. But I wouldn't be able to play it half as good as you. 
RESPONSE: Maybe. But I guess we'll find out, one day. 
HUMAN: Perhaps, yeah. Until then, though... We've got some more urgent business to take care of. 
RESPONSE: Oh, so that's what it's about? They had to call you in, just for me? 
HUMAN: You've been telling a lot of interesting stories, from what I heard. 
RESPONSE: Just the odd tale, here and there. Though I'd imagine Atlas and Gregor told you everything, already. 
HUMAN: I'm sure. But I also bet there's a lot more than just that. 
RESPONSE: Maybe. Wanna find out? 
HUMAN: With pleasure. 
RESPONSE: Glad to hear that. To be honest... I've grown a bit bored, anyway. 

[e]HUMAN: Your name is Timotej Stojanov. Two days ago, you helped facilitate an armed insurrection in the city state of Trachi. Going against your given orders, you caused irreparable damage to both the Ionian intelligence network and the nation as a whole. You are therefore charged with treason. Do you plead guilty? 
RESPONSE: Hm? Oh, sorry. I didn't quite catch that. Would you mind saying that again? 

[t]HUMAN: Let's make it official!
RESPONSE: Can't believe it's finally happening. 

[t]HUMAN: Right. You have the keys? 
RESPONSE: Mhm. 
HUMAN: So... What's next? 
RESPONSE: Opening boxes that should stay closed.

[t]HUMAN: Hey, Ganymede! 
RESPONSE: You're back. 
HUMAN: Yeah. And you're on your feet again. 
RESPONSE: Still a bit shaky. But getting better by the minute. 
HUMAN: Glad to hear that. 
RESPONSE: Listen... I'm sorry for what happened, last night. 
HUMAN: It's alright. We weren't supposed to be in those sewers, anyway. 
RESPONSE: Still.. Thanks for saving me. 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. 
RESPONSE: So... How did your meeting with Faber go? 
HUMAN: As expected. He's a bunch of work, to put it mildly. 
RESPONSE: Did he say anything about what happened at the checkpoint? 
HUMAN: He claimed that Amryn somehow got wind of our plans. And that he was forced to put up a show. 
RESPONSE: You think he's telling the truth? 
HUMAN: Who knows... But I intend to find out. You know where Amryn's embassy is? 
RESPONSE: Uhmm... It's west of here, isn't it? In Gharten Street, I think? 
HUMAN: Precisely. Just head across Trenton Plaza and keep to the northwest. The embassy is the first house to your right. 
RESPONSE: Got it! 
HUMAN: Don't know if you've seen it... But they're conducting identity checks on some of the bridges. 
RESPONSE: Yeah, there's Guardsmen all over the place. You've been to Trachi before, right? 
HUMAN: Some time ago, yeah. But it felt very different, back then. 
RESPONSE: I see. 
HUMAN: In any case. Faber gave me the papers he promised. 
RESPONSE: You want me to use them? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE: You sure about that? Feels like he's just gonna try to track us with that. 
HUMAN: Exactly. 
RESPONSE: I see. So what do you want me to do? 
HUMAN: Nothing extraordinary. Just keep an eye on the embassy. See who enters and who leaves. If what Faber says is true... They're likely to use something, or someone, to communicate with the leak. 
RESPONSE: Makes sense. Alright. I'll be back later, then. 
HUMAN: Good luck out there. 
RESPONSE: Thank you!

[t]HUMAN: Can you charm her up a bit?
RESPONSE: Just keeping her busy, then? 
HUMAN: Exactly. Let Daphne handle the rest. 
RESPONSE: Okay. 
HUMAN: I'll go and get into position, then. See you there. 
RESPONSE: For sure!

[t]HUMAN: You're feeling better, Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: Yeah, I'm good to go. Thanks for asking! 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. How did your survey go? 
RESPONSE: Alright, I guess. Though it's hard to make sense of it all.

[t]HUMAN: I heard the same. But I guess we'll have to see what happens. Apparently, Amryn has also heavily increased their presence within the city. 
RESPONSE: Do they know we're here? 
HUMAN: It's hard to tell. But I intend to find out. Have you been to Gharten Street, yet? 
RESPONSE: Nope. It's west of here, isn't it? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Just cross one of the bridges, and orient yourself northwest of Trenton Plaza. 
RESPONSE: Alright. 
HUMAN: Once you're there, you should see a big, old-style building to your right. That's the Amrynian embassy. I want you to keep a watch over that place. And make note of anyone entering or leaving it. 
RESPONSE: Will do!

[t]HUMAN: Good work out there. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Hm? Something wrong? 
RESPONSE: All good, don't worry. It just... Feels like we're about to cross a line with what we're doing. 
HUMAN: Don't know if it makes you feel any better... But it's not easy on me, either. 
RESPONSE: I wasn't sure, to be honest. You always seem so confident. Got me a bit envious, to be honest! 
HUMAN: Awww... That's how you see me? Guess I'm that good at hiding it. 
RESPONSE: Have you ever done anything like this before? 
HUMAN: I'm afraid that's classified. 
RESPONSE: Thought as much. So, what's next? 
HUMAN: I'm gonna relay that the stage for tonight is set. As for you... One of our contacts in the Guard has asked for a meeting. Normally, Atlas would handle stuff like that. But he's off on some goose-chase after one of Amryn's people. So I guess you'll have to do the honours. 
RESPONSE: Who am I meeting? 
HUMAN: His name is Arnold Francesco Solka. 
RESPONSE: Wait! COLONEL Solka? 
HUMAN: The man himself. 
RESPONSE: He's one of our people? 
HUMAN: Sort of. We know something he doesn't want us to know. So we do each other a little favour, here and there. Anyways... There's a chance our hit tonight won't be enough. If that's the case... We'll need his troops. 
RESPONSE: I see. 
HUMAN: There's more. Tanner might become a problem, down the line. So, hopefully... Solka can fill in some of the gaps for us. 
RESPONSE: Where's the meeting taking place? 
HUMAN: The prefecture in Sigmund Plaza. His office. Second floor. 
RESPONSE: You're shitting me. 
HUMAN: Those are the parameters. 
RESPONSE: Hm. 
HUMAN: You'll be running under the identity of a corporal named Theodore Harrington. The name's in their books, so it should stand scrutiny. And of course... We also got you a uniform. So as long as you're not sniffing around too much... You'll be fine. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'll go and get changed, then. 
HUMAN: How does it feel? 
RESPONSE: It's a bit stiff in places. But it'll do. 
HUMAN: Glad to hear it. 
RESPONSE: I'm gonna head out, then. 
HUMAN: Okay. Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: Ya? 
HUMAN: Don't do anything I wouldn't do. 
RESPONSE: If you say so. 

[e]HUMAN: I see. If Amryn has someone in the administration, it could be problematic. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. What about our people? 
HUMAN: We'll have to make find out who's on our side, first. Can you deliver a message for me? 
RESPONSE: Of course! 
HUMAN: There's a wine trader in Clarin square. Ask him for a Chariot 1896. And give him this. 
RESPONSE: Alright. 
HUMAN: And while you're there... Would you mind keeping an eye on the custom's office after you're done? 
RESPONSE: Can do! 
HUMAN: Good. I'll see you later, then. 
RESPONSE: I'll make sure to see you first!

[t]HUMAN: How did it go? 
RESPONSE: He went to the custom's office, but I lost him in there. 
HUMAN: I see. If Amryn has someone in the administration, it could be problematic. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. What about our people? 
HUMAN: We'll have to make find out who's on our side, first. Can you deliver a message for me? 
RESPONSE: Of course! 
HUMAN: There's a wine trader in Clarin square. Ask him for a Chariot 1896. And give him this. 
RESPONSE: Alright. 
HUMAN: And while you're there... Would you mind keeping an eye on the custom's office after you're done? 
RESPONSE: Can do! 
HUMAN: Good. I'll see you later, then. 
RESPONSE: Laters~!

[t]HUMAN: Back already? 
RESPONSE: Yeah! 
HUMAN: Did you find something? 
RESPONSE: Yup! I trailed a guy from the embassy to Hudsman. He dropped a message just north of it. 
HUMAN: What did it say? 
RESPONSE: A bunch of numbers. Let me think... 9799... 2345... 7542. Can you make anything of it? 
HUMAN: I'm not sure. It's been a while since we've gotten hold on one of their books. But I'll check it out. Did you see who's on the other side? 
RESPONSE: Yeah! He went into that house over there. 
HUMAN: Oh? 
RESPONSE: So I might as well keep watch from up here. 
HUMAN: I see. Don't let me keep you, then. 
RESPONSE: Oh, I almost forgot. I came across Tillian. 
HUMAN: Is that so? Anything important he had to say? 
RESPONSE: Not really... But it made me remember something. That councillor we met in Nestville... 
HUMAN: De Bloom, you mean? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Who is he? 
HUMAN: He used to be the administrator of Rondham, until last year. 
RESPONSE: What happened? 
HUMAN: Shortly after Trachi declared its independence, there was a heated discussion on how to handle citizenship. Rondham has always harboured a lot of Ionians, among other foreigners. As you know, the provisionary parliament decided to make Trachian citizenship exclusive. In other words, a lot of Ionians had to either relinquish their original citizenship... Or pack their things and leave. Naturally, Ionia wasn't exactly pleased about that. So they tried to kill that motion. 
RESPONSE: Through De Bloom? 
HUMAN: Exactly. 
RESPONSE: But it went through, regardless. 
HUMAN: Yup. Mainly because Faber backed it. Most foreigners in Trachi didn't care much about it. But some of them decided to return to their home country. Others went to the DMZ and founded Nestville. 
RESPONSE: And De Bloom? 
HUMAN: He lost a significiant part of his electoral base. And was unseated by another candidate during last year's election. 
RESPONSE: So he went to Nestville? 
HUMAN: Correct. 
RESPONSE: I see. Can I ask you something? 
HUMAN: Go ahead. 
RESPONSE: Our little detour through Nestville... Was that planned? 
HUMAN: What do you mean by that? 
RESPONSE: Well... To me, it looks like we've just followed a script. The chicanery at the checkpoint... And it just so happens that there's this village, nearby. You can't tell me that the option wasn't on the table. 
HUMAN: Hm... 
RESPONSE: Atlas? 
HUMAN: If that were the case, we could've saved ourselves a lot of time if we just went there, directly. 
RESPONSE: But we needed to keep up the facade. We're not really here to negotiate. Are we? 
HUMAN: Depends on who you're asking. But as far as Faber is concerned... We don't expect him to cooperate. 
RESPONSE: So we're gearing up for war? 
HUMAN: Not if we can prevent it. Which is why we should keep our eyes on what's in front of us. 
RESPONSE: Right! I totally forgot about that! Thanks, though. 
HUMAN: For what? 
RESPONSE: For being honest with me. 

[e]HUMAN: Look! The door!
RESPONSE: Alright. He's leaving. Looks like he's headed towards Pike Bridge. 

[e]HUMAN: Can you find out more about this guy?
RESPONSE: I'm gonna go and keep an eye on him. Be back in a bit. 
HUMAN: Good hunting. 
RESPONSE: Merci beaucoup! 😚

[t]HUMAN: You can trust me.
RESPONSE: Not gonna make that mistake twice.

[t]HUMAN: What about the others?
RESPONSE: Looks like they're not back yet. Might as well change and get going. 
HUMAN: Going where?
RESPONSE: My date with Mr. Solka!

[e]HUMAN: Ready to go? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 

[t]HUMAN: Something wrong? 
RESPONSE: I'm not sure. But there's something in the air. 
HUMAN: Could be the sirocco. 
RESPONSE: Maybe. So... Where to? 
HUMAN: You know where the Old Admirality is? 
RESPONSE: Think it was on the eastern tail of the city, right? 
HUMAN: Spot on! 
RESPONSE: Alright. 

[t]HUMAN: Hello Sir. Your papers, please. 
RESPONSE: I'm afraid we left them at home. I'll bring them with next time!

[t]HUMAN: Hello Sir. Your papers, please. 
RESPONSE: There you go. 
HUMAN: Thank you for your cooperation. 
RESPONSE: Thank YOU for doing your duty so admirably!

[t]HUMAN: Hey there. You alright? 
RESPONSE: Yeah, I'm good. Just my first time in the city. 
HUMAN: Yeah, this place really packs a heat during August. Make sure to drink a lot and keep yourself cool! 
RESPONSE: Thanks, I'll do that. 
HUMAN: No problem, mate. Hope you have a good time here. And if you want to have a REALLY good time... There's this brothel down in Karlin Street- 
RESPONSE: I appreciate it, but I'm gonna have to pass on that. 

[t]HUMAN: He went in through that door.
RESPONSE: That's where he lives? Hmm... Might as well report back while I'm here. 

[t]HUMAN: Hey, you! Have I seen you around here before? 
RESPONSE: Who, me? 
HUMAN: Yes, you! 
RESPONSE: Sorry, was just having a look around. 
HUMAN: Well, go loiter somewhere else. There's people trying to work here, if you haven't noticed. 
RESPONSE:

[t]HUMAN: Look – ut's him!
RESPONSE: Now to find a spot where I can see who's passing by... Like that conveniently placed bench over there. 

[t]HUMAN: Where did he go?
RESPONSE: Looks like he's heading to Rondham. 

[t]HUMAN: Thought I saw you there. 
RESPONSE: Tillian was it, right? 
HUMAN: Yeah. How's your stay in Trachi, so far? 
RESPONSE: Pretty overwhelming, I've got to admit. 
HUMAN: It's a lot to take in, for sure! 
RESPONSE: What about you? Did you manage to take care of your stuff? 
HUMAN: Yeah... I guess you could say that. Looks like I'm gonna have to stay in the city for a while, though. So if you ever need a guide or anything, let me know. 
RESPONSE: Will do! Right, I gotta go. I'll see you around! 
HUMAN: Yeah, for sure! Have a good one! 
RESPONSE: Alright. Time to check out that alley, back there. 

[t]HUMAN: What's being a spy like?
RESPONSE: Lot of waiting. 

[t]HUMAN: Sorry, I've got to go!
RESPONSE: Oh? Someone seems to be in a rush. 

[t]HUMAN: Yo. Can I help you? 
RESPONSE: All good! Just having a look around. Don't let me keep you! 
HUMAN: Heh. How much do you want? 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry? 
HUMAN: Oh... You're not here because of that? 
RESPONSE: I guess not! 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE: Just out of interest... What do you got? 
HUMAN: How do I know you're not one the Guardies? 
RESPONSE: You don't. But there's one right over there. Want to go and ask him? Just kidding, of course! Not like he'd believe me, anyway. Right? 
HUMAN: Chario. 
RESPONSE: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me. 
HUMAN: No problem, man. And good luck. 
RESPONSE: You too, friend. 

[t]HUMAN: Are you okay?
RESPONSE: ... W-what? W-where am I? Wait a second... Am I... ...Home? 
HUMAN: You're doing the thing again.
RESPONSE: ... Again? What the fuck is going on with me? 
HUMAN: Yeah.
RESPONSE: ... Already? Damn... 
HUMAN: There's a little teddy-bear.
RESPONSE: Is that... Chiron? 
HUMAN: And a peacer of paper.
RESPONSE: Hmm... There's letters... D-... Dea... I can't make them out. 
HUMAN: Can you try again?
RESPONSE: It's no use. 
HUMAN: I know you can do it!
RESPONSE: D-... Dea... Dear. G-ga... ...nymede? 

[t]HUMAN: Did someone leave you a message?
RESPONSE: Yeah. Who wrote this? 
HUMAN: Can you read it agaiN?
RESPONSE: I already know what it says. 

[t]HUMAN: Did you look in there?
RESPONSE: Hmm.. The drawers are stuck. 
HUMAN: Try pulling a bit harder.
RESPONSE: Still won't open. 
HUMAN: Please, I need to see what's in there.
RESPONSE: Hm. You really want to? 
HUMAN: Yes!
RESPONSE: Alright. Don't say I didn't warn you. 

[e]HUMAN: There was a story about a dog.
RESPONSE: Anton, yeah.
HUMAN: What happened to him?
RESPONSE: Do you remember I had this argument with another kid?
HUMAN: Mhm.
RESPONSE: Anton was put down two days after that. Because that's what happens to the things I love. 
HUMAN: I'm sorry to hear that. What happend to the other kid?
RESPONSE: I killed him. With my own hands. I can still see the blood, when I close my eyes. And now... You've seen it, too. 

[t]HUMAN: How did it go? 
RESPONSE: ... 
HUMAN: Not good? 
RESPONSE: Let's put it this way: These guys were so riled up... I almost joined them! 
HUMAN: Nice going! 
RESPONSE: Thanks! How's the driver? 
HUMAN: Pretty nervous. But I guess that's to be expected. 
RESPONSE: And Forten? 
HUMAN: Just finished his speech. Should get underway, soon. 
RESPONSE: Good. Are we watching it? 
HUMAN: You bet! 
RESPONSE: Ideal!

[t]HUMAN: You're the new guy? 
RESPONSE: Yep. 
HUMAN: Hm... 
RESPONSE: Something wrong? 
HUMAN: How old are you? 
RESPONSE: That's none of your business. 
HUMAN: Is that so? Ganymede, was it, right? 
RESPONSE: Mhm. 
HUMAN: Alright. I think you'll do. 
RESPONSE: Great! Because I'm sure you'll do, too!

[e]HUMAN: You think you can convince them? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. I've been to places likes this one. All it needs is a little nudge. 
HUMAN: We're talking about real people, here. 
RESPONSE: I know. That's what makes it fun. Right? 
HUMAN: ... 
RESPONSE: Oh, come on! You're in this business, whether you like it, or not. And if we don't make a move, soon... We'll lose our chance. 
HUMAN: Doesn't mean you have to enjoy it. 
RESPONSE: But it also doesn't make any difference. You think that guy, Forten... Cares whether we grit our teeth? I wouldn't. Face it. We're good at this. It's what we're made for. Life is war. And we're survivors. Just like our dear general. 
HUMAN: I'm not concerned about him. 
RESPONSE: Yeah, I get it. These poor people... They don't deserve it, right? Granted, they probably don't. But they've put themselves in the line of fire. They're fanatics. And all we're doing... Is to offer a bit of encouragement. My point is... This is happening, either way. So we might as well enjoy the ride. 
HUMAN: Hm... I gotta say... I underestimated you. 
RESPONSE: Join the queue. 
HUMAN: But there's a question on my mind. 
RESPONSE: Hit me. 
HUMAN: You like to put that innocent little act upfront. So what I'm speaking to right now... Is your second line of defense. Now, I'm wondering... What's beyond that? So tell me... What's the real Ganymede like? 
RESPONSE: That angle, really? Okay... You'll do. 

[t]HUMAN: You sure you got everything? 
RESPONSE: Come on, Iky... I'll be fine! 
HUMAN: You're right. Think I'm just sad to see you go. But I guess nothing lasts forever. 
RESPONSE: Yup. It was fun, though! And I'm sure we'll see each other again, sometime! 
HUMAN: Yeah, about that... I gotta tell you something. 
RESPONSE: I'm listening. 
HUMAN: There's a girl. 
RESPONSE: Oh, please! You think it's the first time I'm doing this? I'm not gonna run around and tell every- body! 
HUMAN: It doesn't matter. 
RESPONSE: So? What's the deal? 
HUMAN: She's with EnKAD. 
RESPONSE: Oh. My condolences. 
HUMAN: She's got her own mind and everything. But she will find out. 
RESPONSE: Okay? 
HUMAN: So I think it's only fair... If you knew about her, too. 
RESPONSE: Not that it's any of my business. But if you want to get it off your chest, I'll listen.

[t]
HUMAN: I've heard stories about Trachi.
RESPONSE: The sunset really is something else! 

[e]HUMAN: ...
RESPONSE: Still nothing... 
HUMAN: What time is it?
RESPONSE: Beats me. It's already gotten dark. I should probably head back.
HUMAN: Alright.
RESPONSE: Not much chance of- What the fuck? 
HUMAN: Did you hear it too?
RESPONSE: I'm glad I wasn't the only one. I should go back and see how the others are doing. 

[t]HUMAN: That's the city's harbor!
RESPONSE: Hm? We're already at the port? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Trachi is surprisingly compact. 
RESPONSE: The big building over there... That's the Old Admirality? 
HUMAN: The one and only. 
RESPONSE: Wow! It's monumental!

[t]HUMAN: Can you give me a couple of minutes?
RESPONSE: Sure! I've got a folding chair right here! 

[t]HUMAN: There you are!
RESPONSE: Yo! I was just on my way back. Did you hear it, too? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Something must've happened at the checkpoint. 
RESPONSE: How do you know? 
HUMAN: Our deal in Nestville. 
RESPONSE: Oh! Right. 
HUMAN: And you? Did you find anything? 
RESPONSE: Nope. I followed the guy to the OA. But lost him there. 
HUMAN: Hm. 
RESPONSE: What's wrong? 
HUMAN: Just wondering... Daphne told me she gave you something. 
RESPONSE: Shit! I totally forgot about that. 
HUMAN: You still have it? 
RESPONSE: Yeah, right here. 
HUMAN: Open it. 
RESPONSE: You sure? 
HUMAN: I can do it, if you don't want to. 
RESPONSE: It's fine. I'll do it. Let's see... Hm? It's... empty? 
HUMAN: Figures. 
RESPONSE: I don't get it. 
HUMAN: She's testing you, Ganymede. I've got a question for you. When you fell into the sewers, last night... Was that planned? 
RESPONSE: Excuse me? 
HUMAN: You were pushed, weren't you? Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: Accidents happen. 
HUMAN: Triumvirate entrance confirmed. That's what the message said. 
RESPONSE: Amryn knows we're here? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Someone told them, Ganymede. 
RESPONSE: And you think it's her? 
HUMAN: Maybe. 
RESPONSE: Why? 
HUMAN: Me and her... Know each other. 
RESPONSE: Huh? 
HUMAN: I took something away from her. A long time ago. 
RESPONSE: So? 
HUMAN: If shit hits the fan... I might as well not just go back. Now, Ganymede... I'll give you something special. A choice. I don't expect you to trust me. So I'll show it to you. 
RESPONSE: Show me what? 
HUMAN: Daphne. Let's go. 
RESPONSE: Where to? 
HUMAN: Trenton Plaza. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Show me.

[t]HUMAN: I heard someone's not playing straight.
RESPONSE: How would I know? 
HUMAN: Because of who you're working for. 
RESPONSE: If you're implying that it's me... 
HUMAN: That's not what I meant. We've kept you in the dark deliberately. That's you've been out cold the entire morning. 
RESPONSE: Thanks, I guess..

[t]HUMAN: Sorry, it took me a bit.
RESPONSE: About time one of you guys showed up! Do you have any idea- Greg?! 
HUMAN: Timo. Or do you prefer 'Ganymede'? 
RESPONSE: Nevermind that. How about you tell me what the fuck's going on, instead? 
HUMAN: It's a long story. And we don't have a lot of time. 
RESPONSE: So that's how it is, huh? First you fuck off with that EnKAD girl... And now you won't even tell me why. 
HUMAN: I'm sorry, Timo. But it's vital that the IIS doesn't know what I'm up to. 
RESPONSE: I could've come with you. 
HUMAN: I wish. But I need you to stay in your role for a bit longer. 
RESPONSE: What's that supposed to mean? 
HUMAN: Did Fero tell you about arteria? 
RESPONSE: arteria? 
HUMAN: Hm... 
RESPONSE: Gregor... I'm running out of patience, here. 
HUMAN: Alright. Let me bring you up to speed. In a few months, the IIS will send another group of operatives to Trachi. 
RESPONSE: Cool. Maybe I should participate. And then go dark for two years, without telling you. 
HUMAN: I'm sorry, Timo. But I didn't have a choice. 
RESPONSE: Yeah, whatever. 
HUMAN: I think you should take part. 
RESPONSE: Huh? Why? 
HUMAN: Have you ever heard of an agent called Atlas? 
RESPONSE:

[e]HUMAN: Is something wrong, Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: Sorry. I'm still getting used to that handle. 
HUMAN: I can't really blame you. But we're part of the IIS now.
RESPONSE: I ran across a couple guys working there. They're something else. 
HUMAN: Well, you'll be in touch with them a lot for the next few weeks. 
RESPONSE: Don't tell me... 
HUMAN: I'm sorry. But there's an operation in the works. And I'd rather send someone I can trust. 
RESPONSE: I appreciate it, though I'd rather hear what it's about.

[t]HUMAN: It's called 'arteria'.
RESPONSE: Like the blood vessel?
HUMAN: And the windpipe.
RESPONSE: Because we'll choke the city until it's on its knees?

[t]HUMAN: Pravoskos has personally chosen the EnKAD personnel. 
RESPONSE: Handpicked, huh?
HUMAN: One of them being a twelve-year veteran, going by the codename "Atlas" He's distinguished himself during the FPR insurgency in 1917. And thus helped Pravoskos become head of EnKaD. Atlas, on the other hand, was seemingly content on working in the field. Some people just can't live without the trill of it, I guess. In any case... He's also been to Trachi before, two years ago. 
RESPONSE: Wait a minute... You're saying that the guy EnKaD sent to get our people back... That was him? 
HUMAN: Precisely. 
RESPONSE: I never understood why we let them mettle in our affairs, like that. 
HUMAN: We had to. After all, one our operatives was a former member of EnKaD. Working more or less directly for Pravoskos, at that. 
RESPONSE: The operation went south though, didn't it? 
HUMAN: Correct. And to this day, I'm still lavishing in the memory of that smug smile vanishing from Pravoskos' face, for once. In any case, said operative remains one of the top agents in his field. And I would assume that he'll be able to draw from the networks he's established during his last venture into the city. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Already sounds like I'm in way over my head... But go on. What about the other one? 
HUMAN: A young woman from the psychological division. She's also been to Trachi, but merely as an attaché. Regardless, she as well has performed exceptionally in the past. Have you ever heard about the Leucippus-Incident? 
RESPONSE: I read about it. Wasn't he the enforcer that killed some guy he was supposed to bring in for questioning? 
HUMAN: Exactly. After being reprimanded by his CO, he went rogue and threatened to go public. So EnKaD sent someone to negotiate. Thirty-six hours later, Leucippus turned himself in. 
RESPONSE: Sounds like I'm being thrown to the lions.

[t]HUMAN: What do you think of it?
RESPONSE: Can I be blunt? 
HUMAN: You should, always. 
RESPONSE: You're proposing treason. 
HUMAN: That depends on where your loyalties are. 
RESPONSE: Isn't that what they always say? 
HUMAN: Perhaps. But I think you'll agree that something needs to be done. 
RESPONSE: Still... If word of that comes out... 
HUMAN: I am aware of that. 
RESPONSE: Well, you've got a lot more to lose than I do. But I'm not sure whether I can do this. I've never been to that city. And it's going to be me against everyone else. 
HUMAN: I wouldn't be so sure about that. 
RESPONSE: What are you saying? 
HUMAN: There's someone else working towards the same goal. 
RESPONSE: Who? 
HUMAN: I don't know his identity. But the information he relayed has proven to be on point, so far. 
RESPONSE: Hm... What if it's a scheme by Pravoskos? 
HUMAN: It's certainly a possiblity. But it would be highly uncharacteristic of him. 
RESPONSE: Still... 
HUMAN: Listen, Ganymede. I wouldn't put this on you if I wasn't one hundred percent certain of your abilities. These people from EnKaD... They're used to be in control of their environment. In Ionia, no one can touch them. So I would assume that they can't help but bring a sense of complacency with them. You on the other hand... You've been able to adapt to almost any environment, so far. And it is my firm belief that you can turn your limited experience in Trachi to your advantage. In other words... Let them be in control, if they want. But try to be a nuisance at every opportunity. 
RESPONSE:

[t]HUMAN: Good day sir! 
RESPONSE: Likewise! Say, I was wondering if you could help me... The thing is, I have an urgent meeting in town... But every counter is occupied at the moment... So I was curious if you've got any extra personnel available? 
HUMAN: I'm sorry, sir. But I'm afraid we don't have anyone to spare. 
RESPONSE: I see. That's unfortunate. 
HUMAN: I'm sure one of our employees can be with you shortly. Feel free to make yourself comfortable in the waiting lounge, until then. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'll go and wait there then. Thanks for your assistance, though. 
HUMAN: No problem at all, sir. 
RESPONSE: Hm. Guess that's the end of the road, for now. I should wait outside and see if he comes back. 

[t]HUMAN: First, you should apply for citizenship.
RESPONSE: Oh no... I have a bad feeling about this. 
HUMAN: Don't worry! This won't take long. 
RESPONSE: I'll take your word on that. 
HUMAN: There's a waiting area over there if you want to sit down. In any case, I'll be back in a sec. 
RESPONSE: Sure, just don't make me wait to long.

[t]HUMAN: 🙈
RESPONSE: Hm... Where did you go? 😳 

[t]HUMAN: It'll only take minute!
RESPONSE: Boy, do I hope you're right. 
HUMAN: I got some bad news.
RESPONSE: What do you mean? 
HUMAN: Well... The guy I needed to speak to is on lunch break. So I guess I'm gonna have to wait until he's back. 
RESPONSE: It's that important? 
HUMAN: Yeah. No need to wait on me, though. Actually, could you do me a favour and drop this off at our place? 
RESPONSE: That letter? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Our man left it behind. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'll see you later, then. 

[t]HUMAN: Clarin Square!
RESPONSE: These are the markets? 
HUMAN: Spot on! 
RESPONSE: Fancy!

[t]HUMAN: Let's get to work!
RESPONSE: Yeah! Let's see what's what. 

[t]HUMAN: Where was it again?
RESPONSE: First house to the right, he said. 
HUMAN: That one you mean?
RESPONSE: Should be it. Now to find a good spot to watch it from.

[e]HUMAN: I'm here.
RESPONSE: First catch of the day!
HUMAN: What was that?
RESPONSE: Nothing~ 😇

[t]HUMAN: Which one is it?
RESPONSE: Let's see... I knew it! 
HUMAN: What does it say? 
RESPONSE: 9799 2345 7542... 
HUMAN: Can you remember that?
RESPONSE: 9799... 2345... 7542. Alright. I think I got it!
HUMAN: You're amazing!
RESPONSE: Oh, just you wait! For now, let's put this back... And see if someone's coming for it. 

[t]HUMAN: Look, it's that guy again!
RESPONSE: Right, that confirms it! Now where's he going with that? 
HUMAN: Time to find out!
RESPONSE: You're goddamn right! 😎

[e]HUMAN: What about this spot?
RESPONSE: Nothing here. 
HUMAN: And this one?
RESPONSE: Nope. 
HUMAN: Let's try that one over there!
RESPONSE: It's empty. 

[t]HUMAN: That house right there?
RESPONSE: Should be. Okay! Steady, now. 

[t]HUMAN: Good day to you! 
RESPONSE: To you, as well! Sorry about the disturbance. I recently moved into the neighbourhood and wanted to say hi. 
HUMAN: Oh, how nice of you! Too few people do that nowadays. 
RESPONSE: I know, right? It's very important for me to know my neighbours. I'm Terrence Firaun, by the way. Or Terry, for short. 
HUMAN: Pleased to meet you, Terry! I'm Liliane Hendrick. But you can call me Lily. Which house did you move into, if I may ask? 
RESPONSE: It's right over there. See the one with the stuccoed gable? 
HUMAN: With the green roof? 
RESPONSE: Exactly! I've got to say, Trachi has some amazing architecture. So I'm very excited to emulate some of the work in my own, once I return to Stratfurt. 
HUMAN: Oh, you are an architect? 
RESPONSE: Aspiring to become one. 
HUMAN: How wonderful! Then I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay in this neigh- bourhood very much. 
RESPONSE: If everyone is as accommodating as you are, I'm sure. That's a really nice house you got there, by the way! 
HUMAN: Oh, thank you! Though I'm sometimes a bit embarrassed living in such a mansion right in the heart of the city. 
RESPONSE: How long have you been living here? 
HUMAN: Around three years. My husband insisted on living close to his place of work. 
RESPONSE: That would be Mr. Hendrick then? 
HUMAN: Precisely! I'd love for you to meet him... But he's out on an errand, right now. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it! I think I've taken up enough of your own time already, anyway. 
HUMAN: Not at all! I always appreciate getting to know my neighbours a bit better. Oh, look! There he is. Welcome back, darling! Come and say hello to our new neighbour. 
RESPONSE: Pleased to meet you! I'm Terrence Fusilier. And I assume you're Mr. Hendrick? 
HUMAN: That's right. Now, I'm sorry... But I need to take care of something, urgently. 
RESPONSE: Oh! I'm the one who should apologize. I think I should be going, anyway. But it was nice meeting you two! 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. Say... Me and Lily were about to have brunch in a bit. And knowing her, she prepared way too much. Would you mind joining us? 
RESPONSE: Well... I don't know what to say. 
HUMAN: I'll take it as a yes, then! See you inside! 
RESPONSE: Thank you for having me!

[t]HUMAN: Should we take another look?
RESPONSE: No point going back in there. 

[t]HUMAN: Okay! I'm out.
RESPONSE: Time for me to say goodbye, as well. 

[t]HUMAN: Should we check it out?
RESPONSE: I can't be seen running through their house too much. 

[t]HUMAN: How about we jump ship?
RESPONSE: I can't leave just yet. 
HUMAN: What about now?
RESPONSE: I should say goodbye, first. 

[t]HUMAN: Let's see... There's tomatoes, carrots and radishes. That leaves... Onions, garlic and potatoes. Would you mind getting those from the pantry? 
RESPONSE: Sure! I'll be right back! 
HUMAN: What were we looking for again?
RESPONSE: Onions, garlic and potatoes it was. 

[t]HUMAN: How's it going with the onions? 
RESPONSE: Done! 
HUMAN: Very good! 
RESPONSE: Say... Would you mind if I open a window? My eyes have gotten a bit runny. 
HUMAN: Feel free to! 
RESPONSE: Anything else I can do? 
HUMAN: Mhh, I don't think so. We're about done, anyway. Just need to let it simmer for a bit. 
RESPONSE: Alright! 
HUMAN: I'll do the washing up. Feel free to rest up a bit. 
RESPONSE: You sure you don't want any help with that? 
HUMAN: Absolutely! You already did more than enough. 
RESPONSE: Okay. I'll make myself comfortable, then. 

[t]HUMAN: Brunch should be ready in a minute. 
RESPONSE: Yeah, about that... I'm terribly sorry, but I just remembered that I urgently need to be somewhere. 
HUMAN: Really? 
RESPONSE: Yeah... Wish it could wait, but there's nothing I can do, I'm afraid. 
HUMAN: That's a shame. I feel very embarrassed putting you to work like that and not even giving something in return. How about you take some of that stew with you? 
RESPONSE: I could never accept that. 
HUMAN: Please, I insist! 
RESPONSE: Okay... But only a tiny bit. 
HUMAN: There you go. 
RESPONSE: Hold on! This is way too much! 
HUMAN: Not at all! We prepared lunch for four people, after all! 
RESPONSE: Come again? 
HUMAN: I think Drenem was discussing a few things with someone, upstairs. 
RESPONSE: Is that so? 
HUMAN: You didn't hear it? 
RESPONSE: Can't say I did. What were they talking about? 
HUMAN: I don't know. I tried not to listen too attentively, since it's none of my business. Though Drenem sounded like he got quite worked up. He really should take it easy, sometimes. In any case, I think I heard her leave, just now. So I guess it's up to you to take her share. 
RESPONSE: Alright, if you insist. Thank you very much! I'll stop by again, sometime soon. 
HUMAN: Please do! You're always welcome! And thank you for helping me out, as well. 
RESPONSE: Don't mention it! Please give my best regards to Mr. Hendrick as well. Once I'm properly accommodated... I'll make sure to invite the two of you over! 
HUMAN: I'm looking forward to it! Hope you have a splendid day. And please let me know how the stew was. 
RESPONSE: Will do! 

[t]HUMAN: And that's my place.
RESPONSE: Wow... It's so spacious! 
HUMAN: Apologies if it's not looking as fine as it should. But as you can see, there's a lot of room to clean. And since we don't have a maid anymore... It's a real struggle to keep all of it in good shape. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it! It looks great! 
HUMAN: Thank you! I'm going to head into the kitchen and prepare a stew. 
RESPONSE: Mind if I help you out? 
HUMAN: Are you sure? I'm not too fond of putting guests to work. 
RESPONSE: It's no problem at all! I'd be more than happy to repay the hospitality! 

[t]HUMAN: What went through your mind when you saw Icarus dead?
RESPONSE: I think it was something like: 'I'm sorry, Niky. Really. You were one of a kind. Brave, and always eager. You turned a chicken house into a palace for me. I wanted to return that favour. But there you are. Taken the bullet intended for me. Rest easy, my sun and stars. Because I'll put a stop to this, I swear! And more importantly... Make sure that bitch will pay for it!' 

[t]HUMAN: Farewell, Ganymede.
RESPONSE: I'll see you on the other side.

[t]HUMAN: *Locked* 
RESPONSE: I should go back to the Safehouse and change. 

[e]HUMAN: What about upstairs?
RESPONSE: I don't want to go up there, again. 

[t]HUMAN: Let's check it out!
RESPONSE: I need to close the door. 

[t]HUMAN: Is he dead?
RESPONSE: There's marks all over his neck. Poor guy. 

[t]HUMAN: Let's make it quick.
RESPONSE: Alright. No time to waste. 

[t]HUMAN: We should leave.
RESPONSE: I need to get some info first. 

[e]HUMAN: Is it okay for you to be here?
RESPONSE: Fuck. I should go. On the other hand... This might be the last shot I get. Alright. Stay calm.

[e]HUMAN: There's a couple letters there.
RESPONSE: Hmm... This looks promising. They were looking into us... Very little details, though. Hm? Wait... No way! You fucking piece of shit!
HUMAN: Excuse me??
RESPONSE: My brother... I just remembered. He never told me a single word.

[t]HUMAN: What's the name of the book?
RESPONSE: Autonomy - How Trachi reclaimed itself "Trachi - A history of freedom"
HUMAN: Sounds super imposing.
RESPONSE: I know, right? Totally not full of themselves, are they?

[t]HUMAN: How's Trachi nowadays?
RESPONSE: Let's see how long they can keep their freedom. 

[t]HUMAN: What else was in that room?
RESPONSE: Just a couple of books about the region.
HUMAN: There was also a special book.
RESPONSE: Uh... Let's not talk about that.
HUMAN: Please...
RESPONSE: Nope! 

[t]HUMAN: Tell me about this one over there.
RESPONSE: Hm. A codebook. Shit. What were the numbers again? 9799 2345 something something. That makes... Triumvirate entrance- acknowledged?
HUMAN: Isn't that what Atlas said?
RESPONSE: Guess he wasn't bullshitting me. 

[e]HUMAN: This book looks interesting, too.
RESPONSE: 'The rise and fall of Graikós'. Good riddance, I guess.
HUMAN: You're not a fan of it?
RESPONSE: If you had any idea..
HUMAN: About what?
RESPONSE: Maybe I'll tell you some day.
HUMAN: About Graikós?
RESPONSE: Mhm! And how much better Ionia sounds. 

[e]HUMAN: There's a bunch of papers there.
RESPONSE: Notes on the IIS. Jesus, Greg. You really put your back into this, didn't you?

[e]HUMAN: How many books does this guy have?
RESPONSE: 'The second Ionian enlightenment'. 'On the Thalassian War - how a channel changed the face of Europa'. Hmm... It's all pointing at us.

[t]HUMAN: Interesting collection!
RESPONSE: Almost like someone put this here, deliberately. 

[t]HUMAN: Are those blueprints?
RESPONSE: Construction plans? Wait a second. This is... Fredrick Dam?

[t]HUMAN: There's other people like you, too.
RESPONSE: Man... This is even bigger than I thought. 

[t]HUMAN: Let's check out these notes.
RESPONSE: Wait... Those are about Nestville. They knew we were going there.

[t]HUMAN: Hello, Trojan Boy.
RESPONSE: Oh, great. 
HUMAN: Long time no see. 
RESPONSE: Yup. Go ahead. Ask away. 
HUMAN: I doubt there's any point in that, really. 
RESPONSE: Skipping straight to the violent part? 
HUMAN: Unless there's something you want to share with me? 
RESPONSE: Not really. I mean... You could just let me go. 
HUMAN: Nice try. But you're in no position to demand anything. Found towering over a dead body. An official of the state, no less. Very, very bad business. 
RESPONSE: Right. And I gotta say... That was a really nice setup! Couldn't have done it better, myself! 
HUMAN: You killed that man. And not only that... You also disguised yourself as a member of the Guard. That's right. I know you were sniffing around. Even met with the Colonel. So I wonder... What's it you're after? Trying to dig up some dirt on me, hm? Why so quiet all of a sudden? 
RESPONSE: Hm? Oh... Sorry! I think I fell asleep for a second, there. Would you mind repeating what you said? 
HUMAN: This... Will be interesting. What were you doing in that apartment?
RESPONSE: Sorry, but that's none of your business.

[t]HUMAN: I gotta admit. You're tougher than I thought. 
RESPONSE: You're really enjoying this, aren't you? 
HUMAN: Not at all. 
RESPONSE: Haven't heard a worse lie in years. 
HUMAN: I'd rather you just give me answers, instead. 
RESPONSE: There's nothing for me to tell you. And let's face it. You're not looking for answers, anyway. 
HUMAN: Whatever you say. But since you're still not talking... I'm forced to use more drastic measures. 
RESPONSE: Woah! That's a big knife! Are you sure you can handle that?

[t]HUMAN: There you are again. Can't have you spacing out like that. It's a nice trick, though, I gotta admit. 
RESPONSE: Sorry... I know you're giving it your best. It's kind of adorable, in its own way. But if you want this to work... You really need to step up your game. 
HUMAN: Big words. But you can't keep this up, forever. Whereas I... Have all the time in the world. Are you serious? No. Really? That's bad. Alright. It's a pity. But understandable. Agreed. I'll be there in a minute. Looks like you got lucky. You're free to go. 
RESPONSE: Really? 
HUMAN: Ya. Circumstances have changed. 
RESPONSE: I see. Bit of a shame, to be honest... I was just starting to get into it. 
HUMAN: Whatever you say. You can grab your things at the reception. 'Till next time. 
RESPONSE: Yeah, like hell!

[t]HUMAN: Are you okay?
RESPONSE: I think so. Time to head back. 

[t]HUMAN: Timo? 
RESPONSE: I'm out here, mum. 
HUMAN: Do you want to come in? Dinner is ready. 
RESPONSE: I'll be there in a second. Let's go inside, Anton. Hey! Don't get too jumpy! Stop it! Hahaha! Careful with your paws! Anton, please! You're hurting me! 

[t]HUMAN: Ganymede?
RESPONSE: Atlas?
HUMAN: ...
RESPONSE: Uhm... Everything okay? 
HUMAN: Your face. 
RESPONSE: Tanner got a bit overexcited. 
HUMAN: Sorry to hear that. 
RESPONSE: It's okay. Not that I mind... But are you sure meeting like this is a good idea? 
HUMAN: The more obvious the better. We're at war now. 
RESPONSE: Shit. 
HUMAN: Don't worry. We're ready. Thanks to you. 
RESPONSE: Glad it was worth it. 
HUMAN: For the record. It wasn't my- 
RESPONSE: I know, Atlas... I know. 
HUMAN: Good. Anyways. We better get going. 
RESPONSE: Where to? 
HUMAN: Elysian. 
RESPONSE: The safehouse? 

[t]HUMAN: Didn't think the Guard had any spine left in 'em. 
RESPONSE: Ahem. 
HUMAN: Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir! I didn't mean it like that! 
RESPONSE: Now, I'll pretend I didn't hear that. But I would be more careful about what I say from now on, if I were you. 
HUMAN: Of course, sir! 
RESPONSE: Glad we understand each other. Carry on, citizen. 
HUMAN: N-naturally! Hope you have a nice day, sir! 
RESPONSE: Likewise!

[t]HUMAN: So that's the parliament, hm? I'd really like to see what's inside. Oh, hey. Sorry – I didn't see you there.
RESPONSE: Something wrong? 
HUMAN: Mhh... Say... Would you like to go a date with me? 
RESPONSE: Uhh... 
HUMAN: Oh my! So hesitant... So timid! It's decided, then! Come on. I don't have all day! 
RESPONSE: I'm really sorry... But this is all a bit sudden, you know. 
HUMAN: Hogwash! Love doesn't care for earthly time. Set yourself free... Become one with your desires! And with me, if you like~ 
RESPONSE: Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass, thank you. But you know, I have a friend... Tall guy, blue eyes. Moustache and combed back hair. Can't miss him. 
HUMAN: Oh, I think I've seen someone like that, before! He looked so stern, I didn't dare. 
RESPONSE: He's pretty shy. It's just a mask, believe me. 
HUMAN: If you say so! 
RESPONSE: Yeah, don't worry! I'm sure he'll be thrilled to get to know you better. 
HUMAN: Great! I'm looking forward to seeing him, then~ And of course... We can still have our little fling, if you want~ 
RESPONSE: Another time, maybe. Anyways, I gotta go. Was nice meeting you. 
HUMAN: Likewise~ 
RESPONSE: Oh, and please don't tell my friend about this conversation. You know, shy and such. 
HUMAN: Of course! It'll be our little secret~ 
RESPONSE: Right! 

[e]HUMAN: Yo Timo! What are you doing out here? 
RESPONSE: Hey Stevo. I'm on my way to Lashanka. Mum asked me to grab some things from the market. 
HUMAN: You've got some guts showing yourself around here! 
RESPONSE: Huh? 
HUMAN: You know what I'm talking about! Parading Anton around like you own him! 
RESPONSE: We've been over this. He wanted to stay with me. 
HUMAN: That's a lie! You just bought him over! 
RESPONSE: You're blaming me for feeding him? 
HUMAN: It's not fair! 
RESPONSE: If you hadn't thrown a fit, he wouldn't have run away in the first place! 
HUMAN: Listen, Timo... I know you like Anton very much. But it's Apo's dog. You can't just take something away because you feel like it. 
RESPONSE: I didn't take him away. He just followed me back home. 
HUMAN: That doesn't make it less of a crime. 
RESPONSE: How can you call that a crime? It's for Anton to decide who he wants to be with! 
HUMAN: That's not how it works, and you know that. 
RESPONSE: See? He doesn't want to. 
HUMAN: Shut up, you thief! Come on, Anton! What's wrong? Don't you recognize me? 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'm leaving. 
HUMAN: Stop!! Give him back! 
RESPONSE: Seriously, Apo... How dense are you? 
HUMAN: I'm clever enough to see what kind of shit you're pulling! You're trying to turn Anton against me! 
RESPONSE: I didn't do anything like that. You pushed him away all by yourself. 
HUMAN: How dare you! I'm taking him home now. And there's nothing you can do about it. Ouch! What the fuck! You stupid little... 
RESPONSE: Stop it! You're hurting him! W-what?! Let me go! 
HUMAN: I'm sorry, Timo. But it's his dog. 
RESPONSE: NO!!! You little shit! 

[t]HUMAN: What's that?
RESPONSE: A letter? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE: What's in it? 
HUMAN: I can't tell you. 
RESPONSE: Seriously? 
HUMAN: Sorry Timo. But you know how it is. 
RESPONSE: Right. Find someone else. 
HUMAN: Timo... This is important. 
RESPONSE: Then tell me about it! I won't play courier if I don't know what's going on. 
HUMAN: You do realize that if you're caught... 
RESPONSE: Knowing less is better? For you, maybe. But I'll need something to buy myself out, if push comes to shove. 
HUMAN: You know I'd find a way to- 
RESPONSE: Would you, really? Because I know things about you? Or because I'm your brother? 
HUMAN: Can you please not mention that here? 
RESPONSE: What part? 
HUMAN: Alright. You win. I told you about our new arrival, didn't I? 
RESPONSE: That girl from EnKAD? 
HUMAN: Yeah. She brought a gift with her. I only had a brief look at it. But it looks like they're planning a hit on Fredrick Dam. 
RESPONSE: The one near Trachi? 
HUMAN: Exactly. If that dam gets destroyed, there'll be massive floods in the entire area. 
RESPONSE: I don't see how that's our problem. 
HUMAN: Trachi isn't part of Ionia, anymore. External affairs are our territory. 
RESPONSE: And you don't want them pissing on us. 
HUMAN: If anything goes wrong... CoExA will be implicated, too. 
RESPONSE: Of course. 
HUMAN: In any case... Fero wants to check it out. 
RESPONSE: What if it's fake? 
HUMAN: Then we at least know that someone's trying to bullshit us. This is too big to ignore. And they know it. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Who do I give this to? 

[e]HUMAN: Amazing!
RESPONSE: And that's only the intro. Do you like it, so far? 
HUMAN: Hm. You really think he's worth all that? 
RESPONSE: Silly girl. I told you I'm not in this for someone else. All I care about... Is to see things burn. So how about it? Want me to put a stop to it? 
HUMAN: You really enjoy this, don't you? 
RESPONSE: Am I supposed to feel guilty for that? 
HUMAN: Not at all. On the contrary... You did everything just the way we wanted you to. 
RESPONSE: Really? I think you're bluffing, Daph. 
HUMAN: I thought you might say that. It just fits you so perfectly well. And since you're trying so hard to keep that mask of yours up... I'm going to enjoy this even more than I thought! You like to see things burn, you said. There's about twenty to thirty armed men outside. God... The suspense is killing me. Alright. Here we go. 
RESPONSE: You wouldn't dare.

[e]HUMAN: Let's go!
RESPONSE: I need to grab my things, first. 

[t]HUMAN: Oh... It's you. 
RESPONSE: You got my things? 
HUMAN: There you go. 
RESPONSE: Thanks. Looks like it's all there. Hm? A message? 17. Uhhh.... Where was that again? Oh, right! Okay. Let's go. 

[e]HUMAN: Hey! You need something from the Colonel? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Well, tough luck. He left like an hour ago. 
RESPONSE: Damn. 
HUMAN: Say, have we met before? 
RESPONSE: Not that I can think of. 
HUMAN: Hm... Might just be my mind playing tricks on me, then. In any case... I'm Herbert. 
RESPONSE: Theodore. 
HUMAN: You want me to relay a message to the Colonel? 
RESPONSE: Thanks, but it's fine. I don't mind waiting. 
HUMAN: Alright. I'll get back to work, then. 
RESPONSE: Don't let me keep you. 
HUMAN: Was nice meeting you, Theodore. I totally forgot! I'm terribly sorry... But we've been having an influx on new people, lately. So the Colonel asked me to conduct a check on all the personnel. 
RESPONSE: Oh? 
HUMAN: Would you mind showing me your identification, real quick? 
RESPONSE: Not at all. 
HUMAN: Thank you. Let's see... Theodore Harrington... Wait a second... Are you related to Freddy? 
RESPONSE: Freddy? 
HUMAN: Frederick Harrington. Tall, blonde guy. 
RESPONSE: Oh! No, I don't think so. At the very least, I never met him. 
HUMAN: Oh, okay then. You're from Trachi proper? 
RESPONSE: Born and raised. 
HUMAN: Uh-huh. That's quite curious. 
RESPONSE: How so? 
HUMAN: Well, your accent reminds me a bit of the countryside. 
RESPONSE: Is that so? The truth is... Both of my parents are from Verin. They moved here a few years before I was born. 
HUMAN: Oh! That explains it. Hm... When were these papers issued? 
RESPONSE: Uhh... I don't remember the exact date. But it must've been a week, or two ago. 
HUMAN: Hmm. I might be wrong... But looks like the identification is based on an old numbering system. I'm sorry, but I'll have to check up on this. 
RESPONSE: Of course. 
HUMAN: Would you come with me, please? 
RESPONSE: Well... I'm not sure the Colonel would appreciate my report being delayed. 
HUMAN: No need to worry about that. Should just take a moment. 
RESPONSE: Alright... If you insist. 

[t]HUMAN: You've got to come with me.
RESPONSE: Well, I'm not sure if the Lieutenant would appreciate not getting this report. I don't remember the exact date... 
HUMAN: Hmm.. Sorry again for the inconvenience. 
RESPONSE: No problem at all. 
HUMAN: Appreciate your understanding. I'll be around, if you need anything. 
RESPONSE: Sure thing. There you go. 
HUMAN: We definitely Alright. Alright. 
RESPONSE: Not really. I just recently joined the guard. 

[t]HUMAN: How about a little detour?
RESPONSE: I shouldn't let him wait. 

[t]HUMAN: Where did he go?
RESPONSE: He went upstairs. 

[e]HUMAN: Yes. I have some things to take care of. I'll be in my office. 
RESPONSE: Excuse me, Colonel. But I urgently need to talk to you. 
HUMAN: Is that so? I'm not sure I recognize you. 
RESPONSE: Corporal Harrington, sir. You wanted my report on the Staffold case. 
HUMAN: I see. Well then, corporal. Follow me.

[t]HUMAN: Here.
RESPONSE: What am I supposed to see here? 
HUMAN: You've just recently arrived, haven't you? 
RESPONSE: So what? 
HUMAN: There are about forty-two thousand people living in Trachi. Add to that an uncountable amount of visitors. 
RESPONSE: The point, if you'd please. 
HUMAN: Haven't you noticed... That there's barely anyone about? Of course you haven't. For you, this atmosphere is your natural habitat. The thing you create and foster in. Don't get me wrong. I know this city has its faults. And how rotten it can be. But at least people were able to walk the streets without fear. 
RESPONSE: What are you getting at? 
HUMAN: I don't know how much you stand behind what you're representing. In any case... You need to be aware of the consequences your actions cause. For each and every one of them. 
RESPONSE: Is that all? 
HUMAN: You're an impatient one. Just like he said. 
RESPONSE: Who told you what? 
HUMAN: One of your associates. The one who's made up his mind. This is why you're here, right? To find out if it's true. 
RESPONSE: You need to be more specific than that. 
HUMAN: I can't. 
RESPONSE: Because you don't know? 
HUMAN: As you said it. 
RESPONSE: You've been in contact with that person? 
HUMAN: Indirectly. 
RESPONSE: Who's the middle-man? 
HUMAN: One of my sergeants. A reclusive persona. But very thorough. 
RESPONSE: Can I meet him? 
HUMAN: I would advise against it. He's not very welcoming to strangers. 
RESPONSE: Even so. 
HUMAN: Alright. He's on leave right now. Politics and such. 
RESPONSE: Where does he live? 
HUMAN: You've been to Trenton Plaza? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Then you've also seen the big apartment building there? 
RESPONSE: I have. 
HUMAN: Second floor. Apartment 2-C. Tell him I sent you. Code phrase: "insubordinant briard". 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'll be underway, then. 
HUMAN: One more thing: If you insist on visiting that man... Make sure to change beforehand. There's no telling how he'd react if some- one in a uniform turns up at his doorstep. Good luck. 
RESPONSE: You can rely on me.

[t]HUMAN: Ha! Oh, you'll find out soon enough. 
RESPONSE: Alright then. Alright then. 
HUMAN: I know we're not always in control of our actions. And sometimes, we have to cross a line. Pledging that this is the last time, for real. But both of us know... It won't end. We'll do it again and again. And everytime, we get more entangled. 
RESPONSE: That's all nice and well... But I'm afraid I don't have time for philosophical debates. So if you don't have anything else to share, I'll take my leave. 
HUMAN: Alright. Alright. Be aware of the consequences your actions cause. And don't trust anyone that is being pressured by someone else than you. And I doubt you've committed as many misdeeds as I have in my time. It's not too late for you. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'm leaving. 

[e]HUMAN: So... I take it you're the man from the IIS? 
RESPONSE: Yup. 
HUMAN: Good. I'm sorry about the circumstances of this meeting. But unfortunately, there's a lot of eyes directed towards me, lately. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it. Though I think it's best if we get straight to the point. 
HUMAN: Agreed. I'll be frank with you... There's a wide a range of influential people trying to replace me. After what happened at the checkpoint yesterday... A considerable number of Guardsmen have been reposted from the outskirts to the urban branches. Among them there's a Lieutenant, which, from what I know, you've already met. 
RESPONSE: I see where this is going. In fact... He's one of the reasons why I'm here. 
HUMAN: I'm glad we're on the same page, then. In any case... Here's his file. Unfortunately, it won't tell you much you don't already know. So let me add the following remarks... Lieutenant Tanner is a brute. But not without a sense of shrewdness. That, and his ability to establish political contacts... Made him gather a sizeable herd of loyal servicemen. Mostly from his own branch, working the checkpoints. But his popularity, even within the urban sections, has grown exponentially. 
RESPONSE: There was another man... Heinrich, if I recall correctly. 
HUMAN: A good man. But far too ideological. Freedom fighters don't always make good politicians. Some of them are far too stuck in their own beliefs... And would rather let someone else take charge. Heinrich refused to encourage unorthodox ways of policing. And held up high the ideal of a valiant, uncorruptable Guardsman. This made him somewhat unpopular with certain parts of the Guard. Tanner only had to swoop down and take the opportunity. Supported by the mayor, of course. Who was very keen on the prospect of gaining a more or less loyal asset within the Guard. Lieutenant Tanner... Is a pragmatist. Of course, he proclaims that it's all for the good of the city. That it's time for Trachi to enter the world stage as a force to be reckoned with. It's tomfoolery of absurd proportions. But it works. 
RESPONSE: How dependent is he on Faber? 
HUMAN: He still needs him, of course. But that's not to say he wouldn't serve someone else, if the opportunity presents itself. In other words... If you want to hit Tanner, you can't simply do this through his host. You need to strike at him directly. 
RESPONSE: Alright. His address is still the same? 
HUMAN: From what I know. 
RESPONSE: Okay. 
HUMAN: Say... Would you mind if I showed you something? 
RESPONSE: Like what? 
HUMAN: Something you should definitely see for yourself. If you'd be so kind and follow me. 
RESPONSE: I'm not here to play games, you know. 
HUMAN: I am aware of that. It won't take long. 
RESPONSE: I'll take your word for it.

[t]HUMAN: I bet it was one of the Guardsmen. The people working the checkpoints are some real ruffians, I heard! 
RESPONSE: Excuse me? 
HUMAN: Oh god! I'm sorry! 
RESPONSE: Don't worry. I won't tell on you. Or will I? 
HUMAN: Please don't! I'm really, really sorry! 
RESPONSE: Relax! I'm just messing with you! 
HUMAN: Haha, of course! But still... I'll be more careful in the future! 
RESPONSE: Wise. 

[t]HUMAN: This is it.
RESPONSE: No turning back now. 

[e]HUMAN: Reminds me of our first night in Trachi.
RESPONSE: Back in the sewers. 
HUMAN: You going to be alright? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Where are we headed? 
HUMAN: Eastwards. Just follow the trail until we're at the end. 
RESPONSE: Alright. 

[t]HUMAN: Over there?
RESPONSE: It's the other way. 

[e]HUMAN: Watch your step. 
RESPONSE: How much further? 
HUMAN: Almost there. 
HUMAN: Gany! 
RESPONSE:

[e]HUMAN: Wait. 
RESPONSE: What's wrong? 

[t]HUMAN: Woah, it's dark in here!
RESPONSE: Careful there. That spot is pretty dangerous. 

[t]HUMAN: Gany... Jesus... What the hell did they do to you? 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it. Just a few scratches, that's all. 
HUMAN: Sorry you had to go through that. 
RESPONSE: It's alright. And worth it. 
HUMAN: Hm? What do you mean? 
RESPONSE: I think it's time we talked. For real, I mean. 
HUMAN: Is that so? Alright. Fire at will. 
RESPONSE: I know you killed Icarus. And I know that you did all of that just to get to me. 
HUMAN: You were there, weren't you? Both you and Atlas. You naughty, naughty boys... Tucked away in that tight little bedroom. Listening eagerly. While I turned the man you loved inside out. 
RESPONSE: I'd rather we skip the bullshit. 
HUMAN: Aww! Is that you... Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: To be frank... I couldn't give less of a shit about him. If I did... You'd be dangling from a streetlight, already. 
HUMAN: Mhhh. Now that's more like it. I don't know if it's your battered face or the sudden change of behaviour... But it's getting me excited. Now, now... Don't stop! Because the moment you do... I'll tear you apart. 
RESPONSE: Oh, don't worry. I'm just getting started! Atlas told me something about you. How he visited your father, back when you were twelve. The delighted look on your face, every time he arrived. And the sobbing mess you became, as soon as he left. Love is an awkward thing, isn't it? When he told you that it was him... Who sold you and your mother out. Did your love for him stop? Or was that just the final push you needed? 
HUMAN: Big words... But I've heard those a million times, already. Everyone thinks they can see through him. Believe me, I've been there. At some point... He'll trash you, too. 
RESPONSE: Maybe, yeah. But then again... I'm not half as deaf as you and the others are. I found something, Daph. Just before I was arrested. Records of our movements. Both in the past... And the future. The meeting with Solka was a setup. Trying to lure one of us into a trap. I walked into it. Because I wanted to make sure. I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Daph. I know you pushed me, back when we arrived. But I also know that in reality... You don't really care about me. For you, I'm just a tool. Because it's not me you're really after. It's Atlas. You want- No... You NEED to know. If the man... Who you just can't seem to shake off - Is a fucking traitor. I'll put your mind to rest, don't worry. Because I know something you don't. You're about to lose everything. Because if what Atlas is trying to pull off works... Ionia can kiss this city goodbye. So how about it? Are we friends again? 

[t]HUMAN: Lorna. 
RESPONSE: Yup. We better go upstairs. It's starting. 
HUMAN: Atlas told you? 
RESPONSE: Among other things. 
HUMAN: Alright. Through here. Up the ladder. 
RESPONSE: On it.

[t]HUMAN: Is that your motivation?
RESPONSE: Maybe. 
HUMAN: Ganymmede... I thought we were past this. 
RESPONSE: That's not what I mean. I'm not faulting you. To be honest, it's much a better cause than anything I have. 
HUMAN: What is it for you, then? 
RESPONSE: I want to see something destroyed and then rebuilt. Over and over again.
HUMAN: Nice speech. But both us know you're just saying things. You're here because your boss wants my boss out. Everything else is just a narrative to cope with that fact. So tell me: Am I on the hitlist, too? 
RESPONSE: If I was supposed to kill you two... 
HUMAN: Answer the question. 
RESPONSE: You'd already be dead. But you know what? Fero can go fuck himself. I'm only doing what I do because it turns me on. 
HUMAN: So you'll tell me everything? 
RESPONSE: Ask and you'll receive.
HUMAN: What's your mission?
RESPONSE: I'm dispatched to take this city off your hands. My goal was to crash operation arteria. And you're right! Fero picked me just for that. He knows about all about Kenović and how Atlas killed your dad. 
HUMAN: Go on.
RESPONSE: Imagine my surprise when Atlas approached me yesterday. It was almost to good to be true! So simple... So utterly profane.
HUMAN: What did he say?
RESPONSE: Everything that happened four years ago. How your boss got his girlfriend killed. Turns out I didn't need to turn Atlas – he's a traitor by himself. 
HUMAN: ...
RESPONSE: That confirms it, right? Which means my job is done. Unless you'd want to make this more exciting. We could make great things happen, Daph. Unless, of course, you don't want to be friends with me again. 

[t]HUMAN: What's wrong? 
RESPONSE: Nothing. 
HUMAN: You sure? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Okay. 
RESPONSE: Atlas... 
HUMAN: Yeah? 
RESPONSE: Are you absolutely sure this'll work? 
HUMAN: What do you mean? 
RESPONSE: Holding onto something for that long... You know how they are. 
HUMAN: Yeah. If you want me to go, instead... I'll do it. 
RESPONSE: That's no good. Your boss wouldn't let you go. Not for anything in the world. No. It's gotta be me. 
HUMAN: I'm sorry, Gany. If you want out... I won't hold it against you. 
RESPONSE: Don't mock me, please. I'd never forgive myself. And you know that. 
HUMAN: I wish there was a way I could make it easier on you. 
RESPONSE: You can, actually... 
HUMAN: Tell me. 
RESPONSE: Well... Give me a reason to hold out. Make it worth it. 
HUMAN: I'll try my best. 
RESPONSE: That's not what I mean. At this point... You probably figured out how I work. And what drives me. I fall in love with things. Or people. Because I want to make them mine. I cannot resist it. And I'll always be a victim to these feelings. I've thought about it time and time again. But I always end up at the same conclusion. Atlas... I'll have to fall in love with you. 
HUMAN: Gany... 
RESPONSE: I know. 
HUMAN: What do you want me to do? 
RESPONSE: I was briefed on you, you know... Not the full story, of course. But I know there was a girl. She was more important to you than anything else in the world. So tell me... What was she like? 

[t]HUMAN: And that's the gist of it. 
RESPONSE: Okay. That explains a lot. But to be frank... I didn't expect you to have a side like this. 
HUMAN: Sorry to burst your bubble. But I'm only human, after all. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it. I think it's adorable in some way. And I can definitely emphasize with it. It'll do. 
HUMAN: Is that a yes? 
RESPONSE: Yup. I'll try! No promises, though. The moment shit hits the fan- 
HUMAN: You'll give them Fero. 
RESPONSE: And if that doesn't help? 
HUMAN: You'll tell them about Hermingrad. 
RESPONSE: Good. 
HUMAN: As for the other thing... 
RESPONSE: Sorry. But I insist. 
HUMAN: Why do you care about her in the first place? 
RESPONSE: If you were in my spot... Wouldn't you want the same? 
HUMAN: That's different. 
RESPONSE: I don't think so. As far as I can see it... It's what she does. 
HUMAN: Maybe. Or maybe you just want to keep things pretty... Before you smash them to bits. 
RESPONSE: You're really something else, Atlas. It's like you're incredibly clever... But also insurmountably stupid, at the same time. Or "maybe" it's just me not seeing you straight. In any case. You're in it for the madness. Whether you like it, or not. There's something special about being in control. Right? 
HUMAN: Hm. It's working? 
RESPONSE: Somewhat, yeah. But I think I'm getting there. 
HUMAN: Okay. It's about time I got underway. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Me too. 
HUMAN: Good luck. 
RESPONSE: Likewise. Áron. 
HUMAN: Speak for yourself. But I for one don't give a shit about who you are. Because the only thing I see in front of me... Is a child. 
RESPONSE: Keep it coming. 
HUMAN: Everywhere you go... You need to be center of attention. A life directed towards submission. But never the happy servant for very long. And so you drag yourself from high to low... Hoping to find something. Or someone. To latch onto forever. It's your sickness. And your addiction. If it weren't for someone pulling your strings... You'd have no idea where to go. Isn't that right? Timo? 
RESPONSE: Bravo. I mean it. Thanks! 
HUMAN: For being honest with you? 
RESPONSE: You know what... One day I'll kill you. 
HUMAN: Feel free to try. But for now... It's mutual assured destruction. 
RESPONSE: Solid finish. Alright. Let's do this. 
HUMAN: Right. See you in a few. 
RESPONSE: See you in a few. 

[t]HUMAN: Hey! You had us scared there, for a bit. 
RESPONSE: What happened? 
HUMAN: You don't remember? 
RESPONSE: Only bits and pieces. Think I slipped or something. After that, it's just a big blur. How did I get here? 
HUMAN: Atlas. You should have seen the look on his face! Don't beat yourself up. Some people enjoy playing hero, once in a while. 
RESPONSE: Is he out? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Having a chat with Mr. Mayor. 
RESPONSE: Okay. 
HUMAN: Speaking of... I gotta get going, too. 
RESPONSE: Right. Sorry to keep you away from that. 
HUMAN: No worries! It's your first time in Trachi, right? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: How about you tag along? And I'll give you a lay of the land while we're at it? If you don't mind, of course. 
RESPONSE: Sure! And thanks! 
HUMAN: Great! There's a bunch of clothes in that drawer over there. Unless you prefer to go out as is, of course. 
RESPONSE: ! Did you-? 
HUMAN: I had to. You were drenched from top to bottom, after all. 
RESPONSE: Well, guess I can't hide anything from you, anymore. 
HUMAN: You should have never tried to, in the first place. Anyways... I'll wait for you outside. 
RESPONSE: ... 

[t]HUMAN: Looking for something specific? 
RESPONSE: Huh? 
HUMAN: I didn't expect you to be so interested in a girl's room. 
RESPONSE: Sorry. Guess I took the wrong door. 

[t]HUMAN: You okay? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Good. Want to go first? 
RESPONSE: Mhm. Just... Give me a second. 

[t]HUMAN: Did you hit your head?
RESPONSE: Where's mum and dad? Was that the door? 
HUMAN: Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: Hm... Something's different. Huh? What's that noise? 
HUMAN:  Something's off about you.
RESPONSE: Come on. There you are. 
HUMAN: Hello? Ganymede?
RESPONSE: Is someone there? Show yourself!
HUMAN: It's okay. You're safe now.
RESPONSE: Who is it!?

[t]HUMAN: ...
RESPONSE: What are you waiting for? I know you're there. 
HUMAN: Peek-a-boo!
RESPONSE: Scare me, will you.

[t]HUMAN: Can you fill out this form for me?
RESPONSE: All thirteen pages? 
HUMAN: As you said it. Feel free to take a seat over there, if you want. Fifteen minutes later... 
RESPONSE: Were you ever convicted? "What does the insignia of Trachi depict?" "Underscore the prime numbers in the following list." Is there a system to these questions, at all? 
HUMAN: Apart from trying to provoke a killing spree, you mean? 
RESPONSE: It's deliberate, isn't it? 
HUMAN: You saw the queue at the gates, didn't you? 
RESPONSE: So they're trying to filtering people with this? 
HUMAN: And delay the others. 
RESPONSE: Why? 
HUMAN: Beats me. 
RESPONSE: If they shut the gates... They'd violate the treaty, right? 

[e]HUMAN: How are you?
RESPONSE: I feel personally violated. 

[e]HUMAN: Ganymede? 
RESPONSE: Hm? Oh, hey! 
HUMAN: Are you alright? 
RESPONSE: As well as I can be. Did it start, already? 
HUMAN: Yup. Do you need help getting up? 
RESPONSE: I'm good, thanks. Just don't expect me to be any help, whatsoever. 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. That's what I'm here for, after all. 
RESPONSE: Thanks. I appreciate it! 
HUMAN: With that being said... Shall we go and see your brother, now? 
RESPONSE: Of course! 
HUMAN: Great! After me, if you'd be so kind. 
RESPONSE:

[t]HUMAN: You can't possibly imagine... How much I'm going to enjoy this! 
RESPONSE: At least you're honest about it. 
HUMAN: Surprised? 
RESPONSE: Not really. But it's a nice change of pace. 
HUMAN: Thank you. I hope you won't mind if we jump right into it. 
RESPONSE: Sure! Go ahead. 
HUMAN: I have a theory. About the way you work, I mean. And why no one knows anything about you. There's a little place in your mind. Almost as old as you. Everytime your bratty mouth gets you into trouble... You disappear inside. 
RESPONSE: I'm flattered. But I don't think it's anything to write home about. You've got one of those, too, don't you? Dotty? 
HUMAN: We all do. Some need a little nudge. Others require a special key. You see... There's just way too much bullshit coming out of your mouth! So I can't trust anything you say. Whoops! Very sorry! Hey! You okay, down there? Good! Anyways... Where was I? Oh, right! Fortunately for me... There's more than one way for a body to express itself. So I'm just gonna keep going... Until I find out who you're really working for. 
RESPONSE:

[t]HUMAN: Wakey wakey! 
RESPONSE: ... Daph? 
HUMAN: I missed you. How are you holding up? 
RESPONSE: I'm not sure what kind of answer you're expecting. But I'm alright, I guess. 
HUMAN: Glad to hear it. 
RESPONSE: So? What's on the menu? 
HUMAN: Well, I'm happy you enjoyed the appetizer. And I think we're both ready for the main course. 
RESPONSE: Atlas? 
HUMAN: Hello, Ganymede. 
RESPONSE: How nice of you to join in on the fun! Ouch... That one kinda hurt, you know. 
HUMAN: Shut up! 
RESPONSE: Or what? 
HUMAN: For the record... I'm sorry. 
RESPONSE: What the fuck?! 
HUMAN: Tell me. Where is he? 
RESPONSE: Jesus fucking christ! How do you think I would know?! 
HUMAN: Answer! 
RESPONSE: I don't know! 
HUMAN: Three down... Seven to go. I hope you'll last through all of them. You know what comes after that, right? 
RESPONSE: Steady. Breathe. 

[t]HUMAN: What the fuck.
RESPONSE: Sorry for putting you through this. But for some reason, I'm dragging you into this place with me. And I think you can understand... That I'd rather be here than there.
HUMAN: What is this place?
RESPONSE: Let's forget about that for a moment, okay? Because there's more important matters at hand. I was about to ask if you enjoy seeing this kind of stuff. But to be honest, it's all the same to me. 
HUMAN: What are you even talking about?
RESPONSE: You see... For all I know, you are either a god or just a voice in my head. That, too, doesn't really matter. Because you're there. And that means the world to me. 
HUMAN: I don't understand you...
RESPONSE: That's fine. It's time for me to go back anyway. I wonder how many fingers they've left intact. Man, that shit is going to hurt for months... Then again, what's a few broken bones for an entire city? And besides... I think it's time for everyone to find out, anyway. Including you, of course!
