HUMAN:
RESPONSE: There's nothing left for us to do here. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We don't have time to stroll around. 

HUMAN: What are you looking at? 
RESPONSE: Is Lieutenant Tanner in? 
HUMAN: What's it to you? 
RESPONSE: We have some business to discuss with him. He's expecting us. 
HUMAN: Yeah? Not that I would have heard. 
RESPONSE: So? Will you go and fetch him, then? 
HUMAN: I'm afraid not. 
RESPONSE: And why's that? 
HUMAN: Not allowed to leave my post, unfortunately. 
RESPONSE: So we're free to enter? 
HUMAN: Can't let that happen. 
RESPONSE: I'm getting tired of this. 
HUMAN: Sorry, I don't make the rules. 
RESPONSE: Are you saying we're supposed to wait for him here until he just happens to stroll by? 
HUMAN: Well... You're not from Trachi, are you? 
RESPONSE: How does that matter? 
HUMAN: Well... 
RESPONSE: Get to the point, if you please. 
HUMAN: Technically, I could let you in... But you'd need a visum first. 
HUMAN: Preposterous! 
RESPONSE: Quiet! Let's say we'd want to acquire one... 
HUMAN: Yes? 
RESPONSE: Who do we talk to? 
HUMAN: The custom's office.... perhaps? God, I really have to spell everything out for you, don't I? 
HUMAN: You call that spelling? It's like I'm watching a dog trying to do his taxes! 
RESPONSE: Let's not waste any more time, then. As for you... We'll be back. 
HUMAN: Can't wait! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Hey, long time no see. Let me guess... You've lost your way again, haven't you? As much as I'd like to personally hold your hand at every step- 
RESPONSE: Shut it. Enough of your bullshit. Now, you listen to me. And listen very carefully. I know Tanner is in there. And I know that he knows we're here. So you either go in there right now and fetch him... Or I swear I'll drag him out here myself! 
HUMAN: That's what it always comes down to, eh? 
RESPONSE: Three seconds. 
HUMAN: You Ionians are all the same. 
RESPONSE: Two. 
HUMAN: But it doesn't matter. 
RESPONSE: One. 
HUMAN: He's not here, anyway. 
RESPONSE: Where is he? 
HUMAN: Like I would know! Checking out some place in the forest. At least so I heard. 
HUMAN: And you couldn't tell us that right away, because? 
HUMAN: I'm sure you've heard this one before... But you never asked. 
RESPONSE: We're done here. 
HUMAN: My thoughts, exactly. 
HUMAN: Getting a bit uppity, aren't they? 
HUMAN: At the very least we get to see a bit more of the countryside. 
RESPONSE: We're already behind schedule, as it is. But I guess there's no helping it... Let's go. 

HUMAN: Look who's back. You won't believe how much I missed the three of you! 
HUMAN: That's rich, coming from someone who literally stands in the same spot the entire day. 
HUMAN: You're a funny one! I thought they'd beat that out of you Shiteonians a long time ago! 
RESPONSE: Enough of that. Is the Lieutenant back? 
HUMAN: Yeah, he's expecting you inside. 
HUMAN: At last! 
RESPONSE: Let's go. We've wasted more than enough time on idle nonfactors. 
HUMAN: I'd watch my back in there, if I were you. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: There's nothing left for us to do here. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We don't have time to stroll around. 

HUMAN: Well, that was awkward! 
HUMAN: This entire situation get's more ridiculous by the minute. 
RESPONSE: Seems that way. But there's a limit to idiosyncratic tolerance. Let's have another word with that cryptic guardsman. 

HUMAN: The world's weirdest custom's office, for sure. 
HUMAN: Seems much more like an asylum for the mentally deranged to me... 
RESPONSE: I think they're far more apt than we give them credit for. In any case, Tanner should be back by now. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: North: Trachian Demilitarized Zone East: Ionia 
HUMAN: Can I help you, by any chance? 
RESPONSE: Mind pointing us to the barracks? 
HUMAN: Of course! It's right over there. 
RESPONSE: Much obliged. 

HUMAN: Glad to have you back! We're almost there. 
RESPONSE: How much longer? 
HUMAN: Well... If our driver doesn't kill us, beforehand... A few minutes, at most. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Don't you guys worry about that! I made it more than clear to him that he better not mess this up! 
RESPONSE: A lot of initiative... For a counsellor. 
HUMAN: Gladly! 
RESPONSE: Anyways... You guys need a brief on anything? We are about to reach our side of the border close to Trachi's eastern checkpoint. Once we're there, we'll make contact with our man in the republican guard. Who will hand us the necessary papers to enter the city. 
HUMAN: Can't we just go through the main gate? 
RESPONSE: Theoretically, yeah. Though there have been reports that Ionians are being subjected to heavy delays in their passport proceedings. So we'd rather not take any chances. 
HUMAN: Gotcha! 
RESPONSE: Once we're inside, we'll disperse and make our way to the safehouse, individually. And support the embassy by gathering intelligence throughout the city. It's vital that the negotiations between Trachi and our government proceed without any incidents. 
HUMAN: Talks have been deadlocked for the last few weeks, so I heard. 
RESPONSE: That is correct. And even though we can't be sure what the reason for this is... It's likely that Amryn was involved. Whatever the case might be, though. We're here to change that. Within the next three days, that is. 
HUMAN: And what if nothing happens by the end of it? 
RESPONSE: Let's hope it won't come to that. Now, I think you're already aware of this. But for the record... We're not formally recognized by the committee. In other words... Once we've crossed the border, we'll be stateless. Alright. Let's go. 

HUMAN: So, what now? 
HUMAN: We could try another set of passports. Though I doubt we'll even get to the first screening today. 
RESPONSE: If they don't find another reason to deny us again, that is. 
HUMAN: How about we use the rest of the day to have a look around? And if all else fails, we can still be first in line, tomorrow. 
RESPONSE: Worth a shot. 
HUMAN: Agreed! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Enjoyed your little stroll around the countryside? 
RESPONSE: Considering we're already several hours behind schedule... I'd rather skip the pleasantries. 
HUMAN: Alright, have it your way. Now, I'm afraid you won't like what I'm going to say next. 
RESPONSE: Is that so? 
HUMAN: While I was out in the field, a letter from the Mayor arrived. Unfortunately, he decided to rescind your invitation to the city. 
HUMAN: You've got to be kidding me. 
HUMAN: It's the truth, I'm afraid. 
RESPONSE: You do realize you're violating an international agreement? 
HUMAN: Whatever the case might be. It's out of my hands. You're not barred from entering the city through regular means, of course. But I'm afraid this particular route is closed to you. Now, if there's nothing else to discuss... I must formally ask you to leave Trachian territory. Unless you prefer to be escorted from the premises, of course. 
RESPONSE: That won't be necessary. We'll be going. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Over here. If you'd be so kind, Ralph. 
HUMAN: Of course! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Hm? Where the hell is Ralph? 
RESPONSE: That's a good question. Let's take a look upstairs. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We still have some business here. 

HUMAN: Good day to you, sir! 
RESPONSE: To you, as well. Say, I was wondering if you could help me. This is the Elysian, right? 
HUMAN: The one and only. 
RESPONSE: Good. 
HUMAN: S-sir? 
RESPONSE: You have the keys for the apartment? 
HUMAN: Y-yes, right here! 
RESPONSE: Go ahead. 
HUMAN: It's open. 
RESPONSE: After you. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You guys clear on everything? 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Test Yes Test No 
HUMAN: W-what? W-where am I? I can't see. Oh god... Hey!! Someone! Get me out! Someone help me... PLEASE!!! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: √Åron. 
RESPONSE: Gregory. 
HUMAN: I'm glad you made it. 
RESPONSE: Right. Where's Eury? 
HUMAN: Should be here, any moment, now. What about Daphne? 
RESPONSE: She's hard to predict. But I think we got her cornered. 
HUMAN: And the other one? 
RESPONSE: Ganymede, you mean? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE: I told him what he needed to hear. But everything beyond that... Your guess is better than mine. 
HUMAN: Hm. You know I haven't seen him in years. 
RESPONSE: Yeah... But some people never change. 

HUMAN: What the hell? Tillian?! 
HUMAN: Took you long enough. Did you have another sightseeing trip or what? 
HUMAN: I knew there was something off about you. You little shit. 
HUMAN: Please. There is no need for this. 
HUMAN: And you... Cerberus. You're working for them full-time now? 
HUMAN: Sometimes a man has to follow his own heart. But I haven't called you all the way here just to reminisce. Your associate. I think Ganymede was his name? He's on his way back to Ionia? 
HUMAN: You set him up, didn't you? 
HUMAN: I contributed to it. A lot of people were involved in order to make it happen. 
HUMAN: What are you implying? 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
HUMAN: What? 
RESPONSE: It's true. 
HUMAN: You've gotta be kidding me. 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry, Daphne. I wish I could tell you that I had no choice. But this time, I did. And as much as I regret it... I would do it again. 
HUMAN: You sold him out. 
RESPONSE: I did. 
HUMAN: But why? 
RESPONSE: Because he was in the way. 
HUMAN: Of what? 
RESPONSE: Do you know a man named Crius? 
HUMAN: The undersecretary? 
RESPONSE: He ordered Ganymede to watch us. Both of us, that is. 
HUMAN: To what purpose? 
RESPONSE: Because he's aiming to become secretary. 
HUMAN: By taking down Hyperion? 
RESPONSE: Precisely. It's important to him that this operation is unsuccesful. 
HUMAN: All of this just to move up a chair? 
RESPONSE: Just like us. Hyperion has made a lot of enemies lately. 
HUMAN: And you? 
RESPONSE: I'm one them, yeah. 
HUMAN: So why not work with Crius? 
RESPONSE: We did, for a time. But recently, our goals diverged. I didn't do all of this just to play politics. Crius wants a promotion. Whereas I intend to tear the entire structure down. 

HUMAN: Took you long enough. 
RESPONSE: And you were faster than I had expected. I assume you found out about it, then? 
HUMAN: To be fair... It wasn't that hard to put the pieces together. 
RESPONSE: How long have you been investigating him? 
HUMAN: Pretty much from the moment he defected to us. 
RESPONSE: Figures... And you've been tracking me, as well? 
HUMAN: ... 
RESPONSE: I see. What about Eurydice? 
HUMAN: I don't think I have to tell you that. If I am to guess, she'll come walking through that door within the next minutes, as well. From the moment he defected to us. 
RESPONSE: Figures... 
HUMAN: I'm not sure how you pulled that one of. But I'm quite honestly impressed. 
RESPONSE: You've been busy. 
HUMAN: And you. So... What's it gonna be? I kill you, you kill me? 
RESPONSE: Pretty confident of you. 
HUMAN: Hm... I guess you want to talk, beforehand? 
RESPONSE: About a couple of things, yeah. 
HUMAN: Well, I'm not really a fan of getting interviewed. 
RESPONSE: Then let me do the talking. 
HUMAN: Oh? Go ahead then. See if those tricks of yours work on me. 
RESPONSE: I'm not here to pressure you into something. 
HUMAN: Yes, yes. We've all heard that line more times than any of us can stomach. Just get to the point, please. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I think you're well aware of the things my people have done. 
HUMAN: Standing right next to the result of one of your recent ventures, I can attest to that. 
RESPONSE: I want your help in tearing it down. 
HUMAN: What exactly? 
RESPONSE: Amryn. Trachi. Ionia. They all need to go. 
HUMAN: I'm afraid I don't follow. 
RESPONSE: You know I've done horrible, unspeakable things. Not that I'm super exceptional. In some wicked sense, I just happen to be really good at something that is terribly wrong. But I'd rather have a world in which I'm useless. Than thrive in one that incorporates so much human-made misery. 
HUMAN: Terribly touching. But I'm afraid I don't really buy it. 
RESPONSE: These are Eury's words. 
HUMAN: Oh? That makes it even worse. 
RESPONSE: In any case... I'm not one for long speeches. So I'll get to the point. You lived in Nestville for more than a year. You saw what a world untouched by people like us can look like. 
HUMAN: So what are you proposing? 
RESPONSE: You're aware that no matter what you might have up your sleeve... This city is lost to you. 
HUMAN: What do you mean by that? 
RESPONSE: Me and Eurydice have been working closely with the leader of the TLF. 
HUMAN: I am aware of that. You were so kind as to give us a reason to finally fight this out on a battlefield. And if your intelligence is even half their reputation's worth, you know that you'll have no chance of winning a war. 
RESPONSE: You're right. Ionia will surely lose. Ionia will undoubtedly lose. However, Amryn is very likely to suffer heavy casualties. Every strip of land along the border has been heavily fortified. The Promeria is being turned into one big minefield while we're speaking. 
HUMAN: Even so. You can't say that this is a win for you. 
RESPONSE: That depends on the objective. Naturally, I helped Ionia along some steps. But then again, you made good use of the information I gave you, as well. 
HUMAN: Oh? Now that is rich. You're claiming that you are responsible for the leak? 
RESPONSE: Me and a few others, yeah. 
HUMAN: To what end? 
RESPONSE: To stall Ionia. In order for our plan to succeed, neither side was allowed to gain control over the city. 
HUMAN: What plan? 
RESPONSE: Eurydice likes to call it a revolution. But I'm much more reserved. Right now, we're nothing but dissidents. But we do have a fighting chance. 
HUMAN: You're insane. There's no way the locals will acept that. Not after all the shit you've done to them. 
RESPONSE: Maybe. But as far as they're concerned, I'm dead. And the same goes for the IIB. 
HUMAN: Pretty risky for you to come here, then. 
RESPONSE: It is. But it's also important for you to know the truth. 
HUMAN: The truth, yeah? I still don't buy it. 
RESPONSE: I expected as much. You'll be leaving the city soon, I assume? 
HUMAN: None of your business. 
RESPONSE: Alright. In any case, if you change your mind... You know how to contact us. 
HUMAN: Wait! When did you find out? 
RESPONSE: Since yesterday evening. 
HUMAN: ... Are you saying...? 
RESPONSE: Yes, I've witnessed it. 
HUMAN: ... So... Nothing else you have to say about it? 
RESPONSE: Like what? 
HUMAN: Of course... You were the one who leaked Clara's location to us, in the first place. 
RESPONSE: Correct. 
HUMAN: But you didn't expect me to do what I did, right? 
RESPONSE: No. 
HUMAN: So why didn't you stop me? 
RESPONSE: I arrived when you stowed her body back inside. Which leads me to the question of what exactly happened, there. 
HUMAN: ... It was an accident. I went to the place described on the note. And found the spot where the girl was stashed. Some of the rainwater had already leaked into the pipe. That was part of your plan, right? 
RESPONSE: Those were the orders, yeah. Control wanted us to bring about a sense of... urgency. 
HUMAN: I see... In any case though... When I saw the state of things, I was left with a choice. This man, right here. He wanted me to return the girl to the mayor. Those were my official orders. Those were my official orders. He wanted me to return the girl to the mayor. 
RESPONSE: Those were the orders, yeah. 
HUMAN: That was part of your plan, right? 
RESPONSE: Because there's a part of me that would've done the same. 
HUMAN: And it served your purpose, after all. 
RESPONSE: Call it a win-win. 
HUMAN: Even for the girl? 
RESPONSE: No. Do you regret it, then? 
HUMAN: Does it ever get any easier? 
RESPONSE: Unfortunately, it does. Which is why it's important for us realize that things like these can't go on any longer. You see, the man next to you... You see, the man next to you... 
HUMAN: Don't dig to deep, Atlas. But why? 
RESPONSE: To you, specifically. ... Then see it for yourself. 
HUMAN: To what end? Alright. I think I've heard enough. 
RESPONSE: You know, she told me about you... You know, she told me about you... May he rest in piece. 
HUMAN: I'm sorry. Well, congratulations. Well, congratulations. 
RESPONSE: But that's not all 
HUMAN: Let me get this right... 
RESPONSE: But for that to happen... 

HUMAN: I gotta say... You really had a lot of us fooled... 
HUMAN: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: I know you've been in contact with him. 
HUMAN: That was a long time ago. And I told the service about that when I crossed over. 
HUMAN: I'm not referring to that. Did you know he was the one who tipped us off about Glundon? 
HUMAN: I suspected as much. But I had no proof. 
HUMAN: And you still took the bait. Which means you're either stupid... Or not on our side, after all. 
HUMAN: What are you implying? 
HUMAN: The secretary saw you leave the building last night. Atlas, who had meanwhile briefly been to the safehouse, leaves around ten minutes later. And the next morning, one of our most valuable assetts is found drifting in the sewers. Now, I don't have any proof, nor do I know what exactly happened... But you've got to admit that this doesn't put you in a good light. 
HUMAN: What are you implying? 
HUMAN: I don't for sure. How about you tell me? What where you doing yesterday when you went out? 
HUMAN: Go ahead. 
RESPONSE: Tell him. 
HUMAN: You're early, as always. 
RESPONSE: Don't change the subject. 
HUMAN: What's the meaning of this? Explain yourself! 
HUMAN: You're a bright one, Tillian. I'm sure you've got it all figured out, by now. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: What the hell? Tillian?! 
HUMAN: Took you long enough. Did you have another sightseeing trip or what? 
HUMAN: I knew there was something off about you. You little shit. 
HUMAN: Please. There is no need for this. What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: I know you've been in contact with him. 
HUMAN: That was a long time ago. And I told the service about that when I crossed over. 
HUMAN: I'm not referring to that. Did you know he was the one who tipped us off about Glundon? 
HUMAN: I suspected as much. But I had no proof. 
HUMAN: And you still took the bait. Which means you're either stupid... Or not on our side, after all. 
HUMAN: What are you implying? 
HUMAN: The secretary saw you leave the building last night. Atlas, who had meanwhile briefly been to the safehouse, leaves around ten minutes later. And the next morning, one of our most valuable assetts is found drifting in the sewers. Now, I don't have any proof, nor do I know what exactly happened... But you've got to admit that this doesn't put you in a good light. 
HUMAN: What are you implying? 
HUMAN: I don't for sure. How about you tell me? What where you doing yesterday when you went out? 
HUMAN: Go ahead. 
RESPONSE: Tell him. 
HUMAN: You're early, as always. 
RESPONSE: Don't change the subject. 
HUMAN: What's the meaning of this? Explain yourself! 
HUMAN: You're a bright one, Tillian. I'm sure you've got it all figured out, by now. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: So you're telling me the three of you have been working together, this entire time? 
HUMAN: In some sense, yeah. You see, the fact that our profession exists is symptomatic of a certain type of society. However, we cannot simply put the blame on the average individual. We're supposed to be watchmen and enforcers. But recently, we've become the judges, as well. 
HUMAN: What's your point? 
RESPONSE: His point is... We can't simply go on like this. There's a war about to happen. And as much we hate to admit it... We're the among the people to blame for it. Of course, we can't stop it by ourselves. However, we can at least do something right. The three of us. Cerberus. Eurydice. And me. We all have prepared a full account of everything we've done in the course of our careers. Tomorrow morning, these confession will be sent to all the publishers across the continent. 
HUMAN: Are you shitting me? You set all of this up... Just because you can't take the heat? And you seriously think it's going to make a change? 
HUMAN: Who knows. But one thing's for sure... The people deserve to know what's going on. 
HUMAN: You guys are insane. If you want to throw your lives away, then go ahead! But do you realize... How many people you're going to get killed? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. But there's no other way. 
HUMAN: I can't believe you... Not content to put me through hell once, are you? No. Once again... You take everything that is dear to me... And grind it into dust. 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry, Daphne. 
HUMAN: There's no need to apologize. You're just doing what's best for yourself. But you know what... Two can play that game. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Damn. I missed. 
HUMAN: Eury... I'll go and fetch a doctor. 
HUMAN: Don't bother. I think I'm done for. 
RESPONSE: Don't say that. I refuse to let you go. 
HUMAN: It's a bit late for that, isn't it? But I do appreciate the sentiment. 
RESPONSE: Stop the melodramatic bullshit, already. You'll live, you hear me?! 
HUMAN: Thank you for everything, the two of you. And don't worry about me, too much. Because I can finally apoligize to her. 
HUMAN: Atlas! Don't. We'll need her. 
RESPONSE: You're right. Don't wait for me. 

HUMAN: So, where to? 
RESPONSE: Forest shouldn't be far. Northeast, I think? 

HUMAN: South: Trachi North: Nestville 
HUMAN: Sorry sir... But this area is closed off, at the moment. 
RESPONSE: That's the road to Nestville, right? 
HUMAN: What's left of it, anyway. 
RESPONSE: What happened? 
HUMAN: Well... I'm not really authorized to speak about that. We're doing our best to get the situation back under control, though! 
RESPONSE: Mind if we take a look ourselves? 
HUMAN: As I said, the area's quite "precarious". I'd strongly advise you to turn around, while you have the chance. 
RESPONSE: Note taken. Now, would you move aside, please? 
HUMAN: Can't you take a hint? This is for your own good! 
HUMAN: You're awfully pushy for someone claiming to offer advice. 
HUMAN: I'm just trying to talk sense into you. 
RESPONSE: And we appreciate that. But if you don't move out of the way immediately... I'll make you. 
HUMAN: Alright, I get it. If you're so keen on hurting yourself, be my guest. 
RESPONSE: We've got to be somewhere anyway. 

HUMAN: You again? 
RESPONSE: That's the road to Nestville, right? 
HUMAN: What's left of it, anyway. 
RESPONSE: What happened? 
HUMAN: Well... I'm not really authorized to speak about that. We're doing our best to get the situation back under control, though! 
RESPONSE: Mind if we take a look ourselves? 
HUMAN: As I said, the area's quite "precarious". I'd strongly advise you to turn around, while you have the chance. 
RESPONSE: Note taken. Now, would you move aside, please? 
HUMAN: Can't you take a hint? This is for your own good! 
HUMAN: You're awfully pushy for someone claiming to offer advice. 
HUMAN: I'm just trying to talk sense into you. 
RESPONSE: And we appreciate that. But if you don't move out of the way immediately... I'll make you. 
HUMAN: Alright, I get it. If you're so keen on hurting yourself, be my guest. 
RESPONSE: This is going nowhere. 

HUMAN: What an odd fellow! 
HUMAN: Eccentric to say the least! Though I bet he's far more gentle and soft towards the forest's inhabitants! ‚ô• 
HUMAN: I wonder what his deal with Tanner is... 
RESPONSE: Nothing that should concern us, in any case. Let's get a move on. We have to be inside the city by dusk. 

HUMAN: That was surprisingly productive! 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Northwards, then. 

HUMAN: You people heading north? 
RESPONSE: That's none of your business. 
HUMAN: Easy there! Just wanted to give you some friendly advice, that's all! There's some scum out and about, lately. So I'd better watch my back, if I were you. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Yo! It's you lot again. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. We'll talk to him. 
HUMAN: Thank you! I knew you'd come around! 
RESPONSE: Are you going to let us through? 
HUMAN: Oh, right! Sorry! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Hey, you there! Mind doing me a favour, real quick? 
RESPONSE: Sorry. But we're just passing through. 
HUMAN: It'll only take a minute! There's this lad living in that cabin, over there. My job's to check up on him... But he keeps telling me to sod off. 
RESPONSE: So? 
HUMAN: Come on, guys... My career's on the line here, damn it! 
RESPONSE: Sounds like a you problem to me. 
HUMAN: Fine! I'll just do it, myself! Not like I'm scared of that cranky old bugger, anyway! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Yeah? What do you want? 
RESPONSE: That's a nice uniform you have on display over there. From what I know, you're normally not allowed to keep those. 
HUMAN: Some people have a hard time letting go. But I doubt that you're here to discuss memorabilia. 
RESPONSE: Right. There's a man named Heinrich. A former member of the guard. 
HUMAN: Who told you about him? 
RESPONSE: Does the name Julius Gaston ring any bells? 
HUMAN: That old fool is still around? 
RESPONSE: Partly, yeah. He's been apprehended by the Guard, an hour ago. 
HUMAN: Happens to a lot of people these days. He's always been too eager for his own good. But that too, is not the reason why you're here. Right? 
RESPONSE: We need to get inside Trachi. Today. 
HUMAN: You sure about that? I'd rather get as far away as possible, if I were you. 
RESPONSE: It's not for us to decide. 
HUMAN: Well, I can't help you with that. But there's a small community up north. Tell them I sent you. Don't know if anything good comes from it... But seeing as you're here... It's probably your best shot. 
RESPONSE: Thank you for your help. 
HUMAN: Don't mention it! Now, if you'd excuse me, I'd rather not be involved any more than necessary. 
RESPONSE: Of course. We're looking for Lieutenant Tanner. Have you seen him, by any chance? 
HUMAN: Not in a long time, no. And frankly, he might as well smolder in the deepest depths of hell, for all I care. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Thank you for your time, regardless. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: That's a nice uniform you have on display over there. From what I know, you're usually not allowed to keep those. 
HUMAN: Some people have a hard time letting go. But I doubt that you're here to discuss memorabilia. 
RESPONSE: Right. There's a man named Heinrich. A former member of the guard. 
HUMAN: Who told you about him? 
RESPONSE: Does the name Julius Gaston ring any bells? 
HUMAN: That old fool is still around? 
RESPONSE: Partly, yes. He was apprehended by the Guard, an hour ago. 
HUMAN: Happens to a lot of people these days. He's always been too eager for his own good. But he's not the reason you're here, right? 
RESPONSE: We need to enter the city. Today, that is. 
HUMAN: You sure about that? I'd rather get as far away as possible, if I were you. 
RESPONSE: It's not for us to decide. 
HUMAN: Well, I can't help you with that. But there's a small community up north, called Nestville. Tell them that I sent you. Don't know if anything good comes from it... But seeing as you're here... It's probably your best shot. 
RESPONSE: Thank you for your help. 
HUMAN: Don't mention it! Now, if you'd excuse me, I'd rather not be involved any more than necessary. 
RESPONSE: Of course. 
HUMAN: We're done. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Can we stop here for a second? 
RESPONSE: If we have to. 
HUMAN: There's a question I want to ask. 
RESPONSE: Go ahead. 
HUMAN: I understand we have to keep a low profile. But we are still in the DMZ right? 
RESPONSE: Correct. 
HUMAN: So why let this guy act like he owns the place? 
RESPONSE: He's still our best lead into the city. And an important figure beyond that, as well. That's why we have to cooperate, for now. 
HUMAN: I see. You think he'll keep his word? 
RESPONSE: Maybe. But he knows what's at stake. That's not what you wanted to ask me, though, right? 
HUMAN: Right. See, I might be wrong on that. But he's awfully well informed. 
RESPONSE: And well connected. 
HUMAN: The way you two looked at each other... As if you've met before. Now, I'm not gonna pry. But he might exploit this, given the chance. 
RESPONSE: Your point? 
HUMAN: What I'm trying to say is: We don't have a lot of friends out here, as you mentioned. Just the three of us to watch each other's back. 
RESPONSE: I'm not sure if that's an assurance or a threat... But I appreciate the sentiment. 
HUMAN: I'd hate to interrupt your little bonding session. But there's a custom's office I'd like to have another look at. If you guys don't mind, of course! 
RESPONSE: Good idea. Let's go. 

HUMAN: HEY! What do you think you're doing here? This area's not safe for civilians. 
RESPONSE: And why's that? 
HUMAN: We're in the middle of an investigation here. Though we have the situation fully under control, we can't be sure if there's still someone at large. 
RESPONSE: Is Lieutenant Tanner on site? 
HUMAN: That's no concern of yours. 
RESPONSE: Answer the question, please. 
HUMAN: As I said. It's none of your business. So you either vacate this place... Or I'll have to remove you by force. 
RESPONSE: Not until you've told me where your acting officer is. 
HUMAN: This is your last warning! Piss off! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: What's going on here!? 
HUMAN: S-sir! I was just telling this civilian to leave. 
HUMAN: That I heard. You may stand down. I'll take it from here. Now, I gather there's some kind of disagreement? 
RESPONSE: Nothing that can't be solved. We're looking for Lieutenant Tanner. 
HUMAN: I see. Well, you found him. 
RESPONSE: Good. 
HUMAN: So, what's your business with me? 
RESPONSE: For starters... Mind explaining why you're not at your post? 
HUMAN: Come again? 
RESPONSE: Drop the pretense. You know exactly who we are and why we're here! 
HUMAN: You're a bit early, aren't you? 
RESPONSE: I don't like to repeat myself. 
HUMAN: Yes, yes! I'm very sorry about the delay. And promise I'll be with you as soon as our investigation is concluded. 
RESPONSE: This is not up for debate. And by the way: You and your men shouldn't be in the demilitarized zone, anyway. 
HUMAN: You're right about that. But here we are. And we won't leave until we're finished. You could make a fuss over it, of course. I'm sure there's a lot of people on both sides eagerly waiting for someone to lose his temper. Or two of us could work together like we're supposed to. What's it going to be? 
RESPONSE: You've got ten minutes. 
HUMAN: Glad we could come to an agreement. I'll be right back. 
RESPONSE: We're coming with you. 
HUMAN: I was afraid you were going to say that. As you wish. A word of warning, though... This won't be pretty. 
RESPONSE: He's got a point. Stay on your toes in there. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We're finished here. 

HUMAN: Welcome back. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? What's your name? 
HUMAN: Why do we have to go over this again? I already told you everything! 
HUMAN: I ask, you answer! 
HUMAN: Julius Gaston... 
HUMAN: Very good! Profession? 
HUMAN: Working the docks, mostly. 
HUMAN: What's the purpose of this hideout? 
HUMAN: Keeping our heads dry until we're cleared to enter Trachi. 
HUMAN: Liar! 
HUMAN: Hit me as much as you want. At some point, it's all coming back to you. You think Heinrich would have tolerated behaviour like that? 
HUMAN: How dare you lecture me on morals! But I digress... Now, I'm going to ask you one last time: Did or did you not try to smuggle contraband into the city? 
HUMAN: As you can see, our things are not being taken anywhere. 
HUMAN: So what's your business hiding out here, then? 
HUMAN: Are you deaf? I just told you. We were waiting for the customs officer to approve our request, then you lot showed up. 
HUMAN: Then I hope you don't mind me asking... Can you proof that? 
HUMAN: Huh? 
HUMAN: You heard me. 
HUMAN: How about you go ask your people at the custom's office, instead? 
HUMAN: We did. 
HUMAN: So? 
HUMAN: None of the staff were able to confirm your statement. And neither was there any record of your application. 
HUMAN: What!? 
HUMAN: Your confusion is as big as mine. Come on, Julius. Out with the truth! 
HUMAN: This can't be right! I was there, and you know it! 
HUMAN: I wish. But as it stands... This is your last chance to confess! Admit it already, you scum! 
HUMAN: No! 
HUMAN: You know, I always respected you. It's a pity, really. By power of Parliament... I hereby judge you guilty of attempting a large-scale smuggling operation. Corporal, the cleaver! 
HUMAN: Aye Sir! 
HUMAN: Seriously? 
HUMAN: Something you want to say? 
HUMAN: Is that how you handle problems around here? 
HUMAN: Am I to take this as an official act of intervention? 
RESPONSE: No. Carry on. 
HUMAN: You're ok with this? 
RESPONSE: My personal opinion doesn't matter. We should go. 
HUMAN: My thoughts, exactly. I'll be back at the checkpoint as soon as I can. 
RESPONSE: I certainly hope so. If not... 
HUMAN: Yes, yes... I know. 
RESPONSE: We'll see you there. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We should see this. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We should see this. 

HUMAN: Woah! Outsiders! Y-you're not one of those mercenaries, are you? 
HUMAN: You're damn right we are! Here to claim what's ours at last! 
RESPONSE: Will you stop, for pity's sake? 

HUMAN: I've been expecting you. 
HUMAN: I think you might be confusing us with someone else. 
HUMAN: Not at all! Three vagabonds from afar, it said. Strong-willed heroes, not to be deterred by any force, be it man or nature. 
RESPONSE: Your point, if you'd be so kind. 
HUMAN: Yes, yes! I can feel it churning within you! A fire smoldering, but unignited. Honey? Are you harassing strangers again? Silence! I will not be inhibited! 
HUMAN: What exactly are we witnessing here? 
RESPONSE: We better get some distance while she's distracted. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: There's no point going back in there. 

HUMAN: Speak of the devil. You okay? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: We miss anything important? 
RESPONSE: Nothing, really. Just mistook me for someone else. Let's see if we can get an appointment with the councillor, now. Let's keep on looking. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: No point going back there anymore. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: HEY! 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: HEY! 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Nestville is the other way. 

HUMAN: Mind telling me what you're trying to do here? 
HUMAN: Considering you're the one throwing random questions at people... How about you introduce yourself, first? 
HUMAN: It's not me who's trying to enter a peaceful village unannounced! 
RESPONSE: You're part of this enclave? 
HUMAN: You bet! The name's Tillian. I'm the deputy leader of Nestville's militia. Now, how about you tell me what's your business here? 
RESPONSE: You know a man named Heinrich? 
HUMAN: You talked to him? 
RESPONSE: On our way here, yeah. 
HUMAN: How is he? 
HUMAN: Pretty grumpy. 
HUMAN: The usual, then. 
RESPONSE: Do you have a village chief or someone we can talk to? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Not sure if anyone's available... But knowing Kris, he's probably still in the council hall. It's the big building at the end of the road. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Thanks for your help. 
HUMAN: Don't mention it. I finished my patrol for today. So I'll be here until nightfall, if you need anything else. Later then! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Back already? How did it go? 
RESPONSE: Positively. 
HUMAN: Glad to hear it! 
RESPONSE: You'll be leading us into the city? 
HUMAN: Yup. The boat is just a bit west of here. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Let's go, then. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: North: Nestville South: Trachi Autonomous community Nestville 

HUMAN: Hey there! What can I do for you? 
RESPONSE: Is the councillor in, by any chance? 
HUMAN: Ah, it's you! He's in a meeting right now. And wants me to relay his sincere apologies for the delay. 
RESPONSE: Excuse me? He knows we're here? 
HUMAN: Naturally! I could almost hear Tilian screaming at you from here. You see, when our little enclave isn't arguing about something, we're able to function almost like a proper community would. I mean, we've only been at it for three years ‚Äì 
RESPONSE: I get your point. Let's wait... somewhere else. 

HUMAN: Oh, it's you again! How's your stay in Nestville so far? 
RESPONSE: Prolonged, to say at least. 
HUMAN: Hey there! What can I do for you? 
RESPONSE: Is your councillor in? 
HUMAN: Ah, it's you! He's already waiting for you in the council hall. 
RESPONSE: He knows we're here? 
HUMAN: Naturally! I could almost hear Tilian screaming at you from here. You see, when our little enclave isn't arguing about something, we're almost able to function like a proper community would. I mean, we've only been at it for three years ‚Äì 
RESPONSE: I get your point. 
HUMAN: Well, I'll inform the councillor right away. 
HUMAN: That won't be necessary. Pleased to meet you. My name is Kristofor De Bloom. I'm the head-councillor of Nestville. Now, I'd like to talk with you about a few things... If you'd follow me, please. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: **Locked** 
RESPONSE: We're finished here. 

HUMAN: Changed your mind? Well? 
RESPONSE: It would be rude to refuse, right? 
HUMAN: Precisely! Just give me a second, I'll set the table. 
HUMAN: I'd be happy to help! 
HUMAN: Thank you! It's highly appreciated! 
RESPONSE: I'm afraid it's still a no. 
HUMAN: A shame. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Just a tiny bit more salt... There... Now it's perfect! 
HUMAN: Certainly smells great from where I'm standing! 
HUMAN: Oh, excuse me! I didn't hear you come in. Can I help you, by any chance? 
RESPONSE: Sorry for intruding. We were having a look around... And apparently, some of us can't resist the scent of a freshly cooked meal. 
HUMAN: I firmly recall you being the first one to cross the doorframe. 
HUMAN: I second that notion! 
RESPONSE: Honestly... 
HUMAN: Here's a thought! Why don't the three of you sit down and have dinner with me? 
RESPONSE: We couldn't possibly accept that. 
HUMAN: But you came here looking for something, didn't you? 
RESPONSE: And you think we've just stumbled into the right place? 
HUMAN: You never know! Well? Great! Just give me a second, I'll set the table right away! 
HUMAN: I'd be happy to help, if you don't mind. 
HUMAN: Thank you, it's highly appreciated! 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry. Your offer is very kind. But we have to be somewhere. 
HUMAN: I see! Don't worry about it! You're always welcome! 
RESPONSE: It's appreciated. 
HUMAN: Don't mention it. You know where to find me. I hope we'll meet again, someday. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: That was amazing! 
HUMAN: Agreed! 
HUMAN: Thank you! 
RESPONSE: I just hope we left enough for your other guests. 
HUMAN: Well... I'm sorry. 
RESPONSE: Hm? 
HUMAN: It's been a while since I've had company for dinner. So I might have been a bit pushy earlier. The truth is... I'm very glad to have someone sit down with me once in a while. And when I heard the three of you talking... I couldn't help but feel like I was back home, again. 
RESPONSE: It's me who should apologize. I had no right to be nosy. I'm sorry I brought it up. 
HUMAN: It's fine. Say... I have a question for you, specifically. If you don't mind, of course. 
RESPONSE: What kind of question? 
HUMAN: Gany? 
HUMAN: Hm? 
HUMAN: There's something I want to check out real quick... Mind accompanying me? 
HUMAN: Sure, I guess.. Well, I'll see you later, then. Thank you very much for the meal! 
HUMAN: You're welcome. Feel free to stop by anytime you're in town. Travelling with those two must be a lot of fun. 
RESPONSE: I'm afraid you've just witnessed the one occasion where they behaved somewhat discretely. Though their enthusiasm is commendable, without a doubt. That's not what you wanted to ask me, though... Right? 
HUMAN: Right! Now, I hope I'm not imagining things... We've met before, haven't we? 
RESPONSE: Possibly. 
HUMAN: Mhm. So... What are you doing here? 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry. But I can't tell you. 
HUMAN: So it's like that, hm? You're still not satisfied? 
RESPONSE: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: You've destroyed everything I ever loved. And now, after all these years... You turn up and pretend that nothing happened. So what's it gonna be, Atlas? Are you going to drag me back to Ionia? Or will you take care of it right here? 
RESPONSE: You've got it all wrong. I'm not here because of you. In fact, we're supposed to be somewhere else, entirely. 
HUMAN: Well, what a coincidence. But since you're at least trying to be honest, I'll return the favour. I couldn't care less about what kind of chaos you are trying to wreak, this time. Go ahead... And do your worst. But if any harm comes to this village... I will hold the three of you accountable. 
RESPONSE: Is that all? 
HUMAN: Yeah. We're finished. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Thank you for having us. It was extraordinary, as always. Farewell, Eury. 
HUMAN: You too... Atlas. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: I'll get straight to the point. Heinrich sent you, from what I heard. And while I'm glad he had someone to speak with... It also means that the matter is serious. 
RESPONSE: You've heard what's happening at the checkpoint? 
HUMAN: Bits and pieces of it. Though we're trying our best not to get involved. And yet, you're here. 
RESPONSE: Right. 
HUMAN: Well then... What can I do for you? 
RESPONSE: We need to enter Trachi. Today. 
HUMAN: What makes you think I can help you with that? 
RESPONSE: Does the name Julius Gaston ring any bells? 
HUMAN: What about him? 
RESPONSE: Don't play dumb with me. I know he's one of your people. 
HUMAN: Is he alright? 
RESPONSE: Last time we saw him, he was about to get maimed. 
HUMAN: Damn it... 
RESPONSE: Yeah. He's likely still being questioned. But we can get him out, if you want. 
HUMAN: You're asking for a trade? 
RESPONSE: As you said it. 
HUMAN: Alright. Under one condition. 
RESPONSE: Go ahead. 
HUMAN: There's someone I want you to take with you. Call it insurance. 
RESPONSE: You think that's necessary? 
HUMAN: Essential. 
RESPONSE: Who is it? 
HUMAN: You've met him, already. It's Tillian. 
RESPONSE: I see. Alright. We'll do as proposed. 
HUMAN: Glad we could come to an agreement. There's a small waterway, just west of this village. Tillian will show you the way. Present this to the person watching the boat. 
RESPONSE: What about security in Trachi? 
HUMAN: There's a maintenance access at the northern partition of the wall. It leads straight into the eastern sewer network. The entrance itself is guarded by a set of two Guardsmen. 
RESPONSE: When does the night shift usually take over? 
HUMAN: These are the records of the last two weeks. Though there's a high chance they've changed it, after what happened today. But seeing as that likelihood will only increase... You might as well give it a shot. 
RESPONSE: Thank you. 
HUMAN: Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to work. Best of luck to you. 
RESPONSE: And to you. 
HUMAN: One more thing. I hope I'm not adding more fuel to the fire by helping you. 
RESPONSE: We'll see about that. Until next time. 

HUMAN: What do you want? 
HUMAN: Hey Damien! You're still on watch? 
HUMAN: Oh, it's you! You weren't supposed to be here for at least another hour. Who's that with you? 
HUMAN: It's a long story. And we need to get going soon. 
HUMAN: Listen... I was nice enough to let you take the boat once, seeing how desperate you were. But I won't put my ass on the line just so you can see your girlfriend again. 
HUMAN: She's not my girlfriend! 
RESPONSE: Are you two finished? 
HUMAN: Who are you again? 
RESPONSE: It doesn't matter. As you can see, your councillor granted us passage. 
HUMAN: Hm. Looks legit to me. Wish I could say the same about you. 
RESPONSE: Whatever the case might be... We really need to get going now. 
HUMAN: Don't let me keep you, then. 
RESPONSE: Thank you. 
HUMAN: Oh... and Tillian? 
HUMAN: Yeah? 
HUMAN: You still owe me, don't you forget that! 
HUMAN: ... 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: It's in here? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Let me take the cover off. Alright. One... and two! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Can't believe it's finally happening. 
RESPONSE: We're not inside the city yet. 
HUMAN: Considering our track record... We're about to get hit by a lightning strike. 
RESPONSE: Then let's move, before it catches up to us. 
HUMAN: Are you guys always that cynical? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Aren't we supposed to go from west to east? 
RESPONSE: Did you hear that? 
HUMAN: Yep. 
RESPONSE: Would you mind? 
HUMAN: I thought you'd never ask. Alright. Listen up, whoever's in there! Either you be a kind citizen and open this door at once... Or we'll have to force our way through! Well, looks like the lot of you won't have a front door anymore! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: I'll take point. 
RESPONSE: Just don't forget to check your corners. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Coming! 

HUMAN: Yeah? 
RESPONSE: EnKAD. 
HUMAN: I'm terribly sorry! This has to be a mistake! 
RESPONSE: Calm down. It's just a routine inspection. Mind if we come in? 
HUMAN: Oh! No! Not at all... 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We have to keep going. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: This one's been cleared, already. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: That one has been cleared, already. 

HUMAN: Uhm... Not that it's my business or anything... But aren't we supposed to search their homes, too? 
RESPONSE: You're right. Looks like I've forgotten that one. 
HUMAN: Is that so? Unfortunate. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: HEY! Not dozing off in the middle of a mission, are we? Seriously... 
RESPONSE: Like there's a point in rushing things... This place is cordoned off, anyway. 
HUMAN: Whatever you say~ But can we at least take shelter somewhere? It's pouring like crazy, if you haven't noticed! 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Let's keep checking those houses. 
HUMAN: Righto! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Another one, really? Well, time's a wasting! 
RESPONSE: Don't get your hopes up. 

HUMAN: Whoops! 
RESPONSE: Stop right there! 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: There's nothing left for us to do here. 

HUMAN: Wait. 
RESPONSE: What's wrong? 
HUMAN: I know I shouldn't be asking this. 
RESPONSE: Then don't. 
HUMAN: You knew that guy, didn't you? 
RESPONSE: You listened? 
HUMAN: Overheard, more like. He screamed his lungs out, if you hadn't noticed. 
RESPONSE: Yeah... Some people do that. 
HUMAN: What about you? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: The window! I'll go after him. 
RESPONSE: I don't think splitting up is a good idea. But we don't really have a choice. 
HUMAN: Right. I'll be back in a second. 
RESPONSE: Might as well use the chance. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I should hurry up, there's no telling when she'll be back. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You're back already. 
HUMAN: Yup. Couldn't find a damn thing back there. A few scraps of cloth, and a bit of blood. But nothing else. 
RESPONSE: Doesn't matter. We got what we came for. 
HUMAN: That's good news, I guess. 
RESPONSE: Yup. Let's head back and report. 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I should hurry up, there's no telling when she'll be back. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I'll see you in hell. 

HUMAN: Of all the people. Are you alone? 
RESPONSE: For now. 
HUMAN: Convenient. 
RESPONSE: You know why I'm here? 
HUMAN: Yeah. And you know that I won't cooperate. 
RESPONSE: A shame. 
HUMAN: Are you sure? 
RESPONSE: You think I'm enjoying this? 
HUMAN: Atlas... Do you remember the day I recruited you? I knew you'd be good at this. But I was sure that someone like you... Someone who has suffered through so much, himself. Would understand that people like us can't help but create misery. It's true... Most of us hate ourselves for the things we do. But you... Are made up of something else, entirely. I don't know what drives you, exactly. But during those ten years I worked for EnKAD... I've never seen anyone enjoy it half as much as you do. 
RESPONSE: I'm going to state this for the sake of completeness... Your name is Daniil Preston. Former deputy to the chairman of the Ionian Revolutionary Comittee. Now acting ringleader of the self- proclaimed Free People's Syndicate. Four days ago, your men seized a shipment from Kenoviƒá central station. Where did you take it? I don't want to repeat myself. 
HUMAN: Would be a waste of breath, anyways. 
RESPONSE: Right. 
HUMAN: You of all people should be aware - 
RESPONSE: I wouldn't stall if I were you. Time isn't on your side. 
HUMAN: Cecilia... You fucking monster! 
RESPONSE: Thirty minutes until we start on the thumbs. Do you really want to know what's going to happen after that? I'm going to need an answer, soon. 
HUMAN: You're not going to get one. 
RESPONSE: Alright... 
HUMAN: What- No... NO! Not her as well! She's a child, damn you! 
RESPONSE: Daniil... As I said- 
HUMAN: It was you, wasn't it? 
RESPONSE: Don't start this. 
HUMAN: You're right. It doesn't matter, anymore. Silk Street 32. 
RESPONSE: Thank you. 
HUMAN: Save it. You'll take care of them? 
RESPONSE: We always do. 
HUMAN: Good. Go ahead, then. Don't let a dead man keep you. Do it, you coward! 
RESPONSE: Rest easy... Comrade. 

HUMAN: So... how can I help you? 
RESPONSE: Just a few questions. 
HUMAN: O-of course! 
RESPONSE: Your name, please. 
HUMAN: Besnik Petroviƒá. 
RESPONSE: Occupation? 
HUMAN: I'm a factotum, doing all kinds of work. 
RESPONSE: Including? 
HUMAN: Helping out on construction sites, for the most part. 
RESPONSE: And apart from that? 
HUMAN: Used to work as a seasonal farmhand. 
RESPONSE: That girl over there... She's your daughter? 
HUMAN: Yes. 
RESPONSE: Where's her mother? 
HUMAN: Died during child-birth. 
RESPONSE: I see. How long have you been living in this house? 
HUMAN: Three years, or four maybe. 
RESPONSE: You know your neighbours well? 
HUMAN: Not really... As you might have noticed, we are kind of sticking out. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Well, I think we're about done here. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us? 
HUMAN: Nothing I can think of right now. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Please let us know if there's something else you'd like to add to your statement. Thank you for your cooperation. And have a nice day. 
HUMAN: Likewise. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Come in. You're late. 
RESPONSE: I know. 
HUMAN: I read your report. A shame it's come to this. But Hyperion wanted you there. 
RESPONSE: I figured as much. 
HUMAN: For what it's worth, he's very pleased with the outcome. And I think you're in for a promotion. I'm sorry Atlas. 
RESPONSE: No need for that. Daniil knew what he signed up for. 
HUMAN: Right. And let's not forget... That you've saved a countless number of lives. The grain is being prepared for shipment to Hermin, as we speak. Atlas... If you're concerned about Dorothy- 
RESPONSE: She'll manage. 
HUMAN: Did you talk to her? 
RESPONSE: A few hours ago. 
HUMAN: Did you tell her? 
RESPONSE: I had to. 
HUMAN: How did she take it? 
RESPONSE: As well as you might expect. She's a tough girl. But I doubt she'll ever forgive me. 
HUMAN: I see. I don't think I ever told you, by the way... Hyperion wants to recruit her. 
RESPONSE: What?! No fucking way! I won't let it happen. 
HUMAN: You know how he is... Once he's got his eye on someone- 
RESPONSE: Fuck him, then! 
HUMAN: ATLAS! Do you remember... How I tried to keep Lorna out? That didn't go very well, did it? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. And while we're on that topic... You need to talk to her. Soon. 
HUMAN: I don't think this is the time nor the place. 
RESPONSE: I'm serious, Eury. And so is she. 
HUMAN: Alright... Tell me. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I'm not a diplomat, mind you. 
HUMAN: I know. You're not going there to hammer out terms... But to enforce them. 
RESPONSE: That's it? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I refuse. 
HUMAN: What? 
RESPONSE: You said it'd be up to me. 
HUMAN: It is. But I'd like to hear a reason, at least. 
RESPONSE: It's simple, really. You're trying to bullshit me. 
HUMAN: Excuse me? 
RESPONSE: Both of us know you could send anybody. So I'm guessing... There's something else. 
HUMAN: Hm. 
RESPONSE: In any case. If that's all... I'll go and catch up on some sleep. 
HUMAN: Atlas. You ever wondered what happened to Eurydice? 
RESPONSE: If you're trying to guilt-trip me into this- 
HUMAN: She's been seen in Trachi. 
RESPONSE: I'm not falling for that again. And you shouldn't, either. 
HUMAN: De Bloom confirmed it. 
RESPONSE: And you want me to make sure it's her? 
HUMAN: Precisely. 
RESPONSE: And afterwards? 
HUMAN: Watch her and wait. 
RESPONSE: For what? 
HUMAN: For Orpheus to show himself. 
RESPONSE: You think he's still around? 
HUMAN: His fingerprints are all over the area. He's planning something. And I want you to put a stop to it. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: With all due respect... Are you insane? 
HUMAN: We need to do something, Atlas. And you know it. 
RESPONSE: That's not what I'm talking about. 
HUMAN: What is it, then? 
RESPONSE: Stop playing games with me. You know Lorna's on that list. 
HUMAN: And you know I have little control over military affairs. 
RESPONSE: Convenient. 
HUMAN: Listen, Atlas... I've been very patient with you, so far. In fact... The only reason why you're on MY list, is because I'm doing you a favour. So if you don't want to participate... Be my guest. 
RESPONSE: You know I wouldn't let her go with anyone else. 
HUMAN: Right. Now, if you'd let me finish this time. I can explain it to you, properly. The people going to that dam are as good as dead, as we both know. Which is why I won't send you there. I've made a couple of inquiries. About the strength of our forces at the border to Amryn. Naturally, most of our troops are deployed in the area around Trachi, at the moment. Leaving the eastern checkpoints stretched incredibly thin. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: The embassy is in Gharten Street, northwest of Trenton Plaza. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Don't you have somewhere else to be? 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Right. You have the keys? 
HUMAN: Mhm. 
RESPONSE: Will he manage? 
HUMAN: Yup. As long as his wife is safe, he'll do any- thing. 
RESPONSE: Good. 
HUMAN: So... What's next? 
RESPONSE: We wait. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE: But in the meantime... We should focus on dealing with two issues. First, the Tanner situation. We know far too litle of him. 
HUMAN: What do you know him, then? 
RESPONSE: Not much. He's a founding member of the Republican Guard. Used to be a mobster. But Faber managed to mobilize him for his cause. 
HUMAN: And so he brought him into the Guard? 
RESPONSE: Yup. He's his patron, so to speak. Of course, not everyone is happy about that. There's also the "old Guard". People from Amryn's former garrison. 
HUMAN: I see... Neither of them sound particularly sympathetic to me. 
RESPONSE: Right. In any case... We have a contact inside the eastern prefecture. And enough men at his disposal to safeguard our bridgehead. Just in case something goes wrong, of course. Regardless, he agreed to a meeting. 
HUMAN: Okay. So? 
RESPONSE: In his office. 
HUMAN: And you want one of us, to go? 
RESPONSE: In his office. And then there's also Amryn to deal with. For this reason, we've activated one of our assetts in the administration. The administrator of Filmore, to be precise. He's agreed to facilitate a meeting with Faber, this evening. At his house in Filmore Avenue. I'll need the two of you to prepare his house for our hit. Daphne. 
HUMAN: Right here! 
RESPONSE: You'll take care of the upper level, including our man, himself. 
HUMAN: Got it! 
RESPONSE: Ganymede, on the other hand... At the same time, Ganymede will stake out the ground floor... And make sure that his wife won't get in the way. She doesn't know about any of this, according to him... So try to be on your best behaviour. 

HUMAN: You're back. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. And you're on your feet again. 
HUMAN: Still a bit shaky. But getting better by the minute. 
RESPONSE: Glad to hear that. 
HUMAN: Listen... I'm sorry for what happened, last night. 
RESPONSE: It's alright. We weren't supposed to be in those sewers, anyway. 
HUMAN: Still.. Thanks for saving me. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it. 
HUMAN: So... How did your meeting with Faber go? 
RESPONSE: As expected. He's a bunch of work, to put it mildly. 
HUMAN: Did he say anything about what happened at the checkpoint? 
RESPONSE: He claimed that Amryn somehow got wind of our plans. And that he was forced to put up a show. 
HUMAN: You think he's telling the truth? 
RESPONSE: Who knows... But I intend to find out. You know where Amryn's embassy is? 
HUMAN: Uhmm... It's west of here, isn't it? In Gharten Street, I think? 
RESPONSE: Precisely. Just head across Trenton Plaza and keep to the northwest. The embassy is the first house to your right. 
HUMAN: Got it! 
RESPONSE: Don't know if you've seen it... But they're conducting identity checks on some of the bridges. 
HUMAN: Yeah, there's Guardsmen all over the place. You've been to Trachi before, right? 
RESPONSE: Some time ago, yeah. But it felt very different, back then. 
HUMAN: I see. 
RESPONSE: In any case. Faber gave me the papers he promised. 
HUMAN: You want me to use them? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: You sure about that? Feels like he's just gonna try to track us with that. 
RESPONSE: Exactly. 
HUMAN: I see. So what do you want me to do? 
RESPONSE: Nothing extraordinary. Just keep an eye on the embassy. See who enters and who leaves. If what Faber says is true... They're likely to use something, or someone, to communicate with the leak. 
HUMAN: Makes sense. Alright. I'll be back later, then. 
RESPONSE: Good luck out there. 

HUMAN: Alright. Just keep her busy, then? 
RESPONSE: Exactly. Let Daphne handle the rest. 
HUMAN: Okay. 
HUMAN: I'll go and get into position, then. See you there. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Hm... He's not here, either. 
RESPONSE: I have a bad feeling about this. ... 
HUMAN: What is it? 
RESPONSE: They have Ralph. 
HUMAN: Who? 
RESPONSE: Hector. 
HUMAN: What does he want? 
RESPONSE: A meeting. 
HUMAN: Seriously? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Where? 
RESPONSE: Their embassy. In twenty minutes. 
HUMAN: This has to be a trap. 
RESPONSE: Agreed. 
HUMAN: So what do we do? 
RESPONSE: I don't think we have a lot of options. This might be our last shot to get him. 
HUMAN: Wandering like that into the lion's den, though? Let me call for backup, at the very least. 
RESPONSE: We don't have time for that. If you don't want to come, I can understand that. 
HUMAN: You know I'm not allowed to leave you out of my sight. 
RESPONSE: Well, in that case... We should get underway. 

HUMAN: Okay. 
RESPONSE: Beats me. Seems that way. Well, he certainly lives up to his reputation. But at least he's handed over our papers. 
HUMAN: That's good to hear! 
RESPONSE: You're feeling better, Ganymede? 
HUMAN: Yeah, I'm good to go. Thanks for saving me back there. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it. How did your survey go? 
HUMAN: Not much to see outside of the ordinary. But you can definitely feel the tension in the air. Also overheard people talking about something in the like of a lockdown, apparently. 
RESPONSE: I heard the same. But I guess we'll have to see what happens. Apparently, Amryn has also heavily increased their presence within the city. 
HUMAN: Do they know we're here? 
RESPONSE: It's hard to tell. But I intend to find out. Have you been to Gharten Street, yet? 
HUMAN: Nope. It's west of here, isn't it? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Just cross one of the bridges, and orient yourself northwest of Trenton Plaza. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE: Once you're there, you should see a big, old-style building to your right. That's the Amrynian embassy. I want you to keep a watch over that place. And make note of anyone entering or leaving it. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I have some business to take care of. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I see... Getting to her won't be easy. 
HUMAN: What about our man in the parliament? 
RESPONSE: He's at odds with Faber, from what I know. 
HUMAN: Can't they arrange a meeting? 
RESPONSE: Maybe. I'd rather not activate him, so soon. Let's give him until tomorrow. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE: What's on your mind, Daph? 
HUMAN: I don't know. But Ganymede... 
RESPONSE: What about him? 
HUMAN: Not sure how to say this... 
RESPONSE: He's an oddity, alright. But I wouldn't underestimate him. 
HUMAN: He's way too young. 
RESPONSE: Doesn't the same go for yourself? 
HUMAN: Point taken, I guess. 
RESPONSE: So? 
HUMAN: It's just... I can't put my finger on it. But something about him is seriously off. 
RESPONSE: Listen... I don't know what you're trying to do here. But I'd focus on my objectives, if I were you. And I'm not saying this for my sake. Hyperion doesn't appreciate detours. Take it from me. 
HUMAN: Can I ask you something? 
RESPONSE: Aren't you doing that already? 
HUMAN: Why are you here? 
RESPONSE: Because I'm told to. 
HUMAN: That's it? 
RESPONSE: Simple as that. 
HUMAN: Are you sure? 
RESPONSE: I'm doing what can to the best of my abilities, no? 
HUMAN: Hm... 
RESPONSE: A bit harsh, but I'll take it. 
HUMAN: That's not what I mean. There's gotta be something. 
RESPONSE: Such as? 
HUMAN: You know what I'm referring to. 
RESPONSE: I'm sure he's already told you everything you need to know. Or maybe not. Because otherwise you wouldn't be here, right? 
HUMAN: It's because of her, isn't it? 
RESPONSE: Who? 
HUMAN: Eurydice? 
RESPONSE: You recognized her. 
HUMAN: Of course! 
RESPONSE: So why didn't you turn her in? 
HUMAN: What tells you I didn't? 
RESPONSE: Just an assumption. 
HUMAN: Are you sure you can do this? 
RESPONSE: What do you mean? 
HUMAN: She used to be your handler, didn't she? That business with her sister... 
RESPONSE: Long concluded. As you know. 
HUMAN: For you, as well? 
RESPONSE: Your point, please. 
HUMAN: I'm just trying to understand... Your relationship to someone who has been AWOL for almost two years. 
RESPONSE: We parted ways long before that. 
HUMAN: Until she disappeared. And you were sent to find her. So again... Why didn't you turn her in? 
RESPONSE: Hm. 
HUMAN: Answer, Atlas. 
RESPONSE: Remember what you said earlier? About her sister and me? I have to keep an eye on Eury... Because I owe it to her. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You better go before you lose him. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: I see. If Amryn has someone in the administration, it could be problematic. 
HUMAN: Yeah. What about our people? 
RESPONSE: We'll have to make find out who's on our side, first. Can you deliver a message for me? 
HUMAN: Of course! 
RESPONSE: There's a wine trader in Clarin square. Ask him for a Chariot 1896. And give him this. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE: And while you're there... Would you mind keeping an eye on the custom's office after you're done? 
HUMAN: Can do! 
RESPONSE: Good. I'll see you later, then. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: How did it go? 
HUMAN: He went to the custom's office, but I lost him in there. 
RESPONSE: I see. If Amryn has someone in the administration, it could be problematic. 
HUMAN: Yeah. What about our people? 
RESPONSE: We'll have to make find out who's on our side, first. Can you deliver a message for me? 
HUMAN: Of course! 
RESPONSE: There's a wine trader in Clarin square. Ask him for a Chariot 1896. And give him this. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE: And while you're there... Would you mind keeping an eye on the custom's office after you're done? 
HUMAN: Can do! 
RESPONSE: Good. I'll see you later, then. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You better get going. 

HUMAN: I was wondering when you'd show up again. 
RESPONSE: It's been a busy couple of days. How's Ganymede? 
HUMAN: Good, all things considered. 
RESPONSE: Is he on his way back, already? 
HUMAN: Not sure. He was still around when I left. But I'd assume he'll leave soon. 
RESPONSE: I see. 
HUMAN: Did you manage to find her? 
RESPONSE: Yup. She's even younger than I expected. 
HUMAN: ... Is she ready to testify? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Told me the entire story. 
HUMAN: Alright. Should we go and see Tanner, then? 
RESPONSE: I would say so. You know where he lives? 
HUMAN: Corner house in Farblein Trail. Second floor. 
RESPONSE: Good. Then let's get it over with. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Back already? 
HUMAN: Yeah! 
RESPONSE: Did you find something? 
HUMAN: Yup! I trailed a guy from the embassy to Hudsman. He dropped a message just north of it. 
RESPONSE: What did it say? 

HUMAN: A bunch of numbers. Let me think... 9799... 2345... 7542. Can you make anything of it? 
RESPONSE: I'm not sure. It's been a while since we've gotten hold on one of their books. But I'll check it out. Did you see who's on the other side? 
HUMAN: Yeah! He went into that house over there. 
RESPONSE: Oh? 
HUMAN: So I might as well keep watch from up here. 
RESPONSE: I see. Don't let me keep you, then. 
HUMAN: Oh, I almost forgot. I came across Tillian. 
RESPONSE: Is that so? Anything important he had to say? 
HUMAN: Not really... But it made me remember something. That councillor we met in Nestville... 
RESPONSE: De Bloom, you mean? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Who is he? 
RESPONSE: He used to be the administrator of Rondham, until last year. 
HUMAN: What happened? 
RESPONSE: Shortly after Trachi declared its independence, there was a heated discussion on how to handle citizenship. Rondham has always harboured a lot of Ionians, among other foreigners. As you know, the provisionary parliament decided to make Trachian citizenship exclusive. In other words, a lot of Ionians had to either relinquish their original citizenship... Or pack their things and leave. Naturally, Ionia wasn't exactly pleased about that. So they tried to kill that motion. 
HUMAN: Through De Bloom? 
RESPONSE: Exactly. 
HUMAN: But it went through, regardless. 
RESPONSE: Yup. Mainly because Faber backed it. Most foreigners in Trachi didn't care much about it. But some of them decided to return to their home country. Others went to the DMZ and founded Nestville. 
HUMAN: And De Bloom? 
RESPONSE: He lost a significiant part of his electoral base. And was unseated by another candidate during last year's election. 
HUMAN: So he went to Nestville? 
RESPONSE: Correct. 
HUMAN: I see. Can I ask you something? 
RESPONSE: Go ahead. 
HUMAN: Our little detour through Nestville... Was that planned? 
RESPONSE: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: Well... To me, it looks like we've just followed a script. The chicanery at the checkpoint... And it just so happens that there's this village, nearby. You can't tell me that the option wasn't on the table. 
RESPONSE: Hm... 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: If that were the case, we could've saved ourselves a lot of time if we just went there, directly. 
HUMAN: But we needed to keep up the facade. We're not really here to negotiate. Are we? 
RESPONSE: Depends on who you're asking. But as far as Faber is concerned... We don't expect him to cooperate. 
HUMAN: So we're gearing up for war? 
RESPONSE: Not if we can prevent it. Which is why we should keep our eyes on what's in front of us. 
HUMAN: Right! I totally forgot about that! Thanks, though. 
RESPONSE: For what? 
HUMAN: For being honest with me. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: I'm gonna go and keep an eye on him. Be back in a bit. 
RESPONSE: Good hunting. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: It should be in here. Figures. Think, Atlas. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You okay? 
HUMAN: I'm good. Just... Memories. 
RESPONSE: I know what you mean. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Hm? Eury... You bloody idiot. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Safehouse. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Describe them to me. 
HUMAN: Both of them had brown hair. The man was slightly shorter than the woman. He had crimson eyes, hers were deep emerald. 
RESPONSE: When was the last time you saw them? 
HUMAN: Around two weeks ago. 
RESPONSE: Did they leave together? 
HUMAN: No. He left first, the woman a couple of hours afterwards. 
RESPONSE: Did they say anything to you? 
HUMAN: They didn't. 
RESPONSE: Anybody else asked you any questions about them? 
HUMAN: Not that I can remember. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Thank you very much for your cooperation. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Wrong entrance. 

HUMAN: Good morning, Sir! How can I help you? 
RESPONSE: Is Mr. Faber in? 
HUMAN: He is. Do you have an appointment? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: What's the meaning of this? Who are you? 
RESPONSE: You know who I am. Don't try to play games with me. 

HUMAN: You're earlier than expected. 
RESPONSE: More importantly... Would you mind explaining yourself? 
HUMAN: Excuse me? 
RESPONSE: You know perfectly well what I'm talking about. 
HUMAN: ... I'm sorry. But I had to do something. I received a facsimile from Amryn's ambassador, yesterday. They know about our arrangement. I had to prove that there wasn't any truth to it. 
RESPONSE: It's not what we agreed on. 
HUMAN: That's open to interpretation. You made it in, after all. Didn't you? 
RESPONSE: Mr. Faber... I'm not here to discuss details. The matter of the fact is... You brought this situation on yourself. And we need to resolve it. 
HUMAN: What are you proposing? 
RESPONSE: For one... We haven't received our papers. 
HUMAN: Of course. There you go. 
RESPONSE: Thank you. That matter being settled... Your ploy lost us about half a day. We'll need extended access to make up for it. 
HUMAN: For what purpose? 
RESPONSE: That is not your concern. 
HUMAN: Well, in that case... I'll have to refuse. 
RESPONSE: Mr. Faber... I thought a man of your rank would realize the situation he's been put into. 
HUMAN: Oh ‚Äì I understand perfectly! You think you can intimidate me! But you're not in Ionia, anymore. 
RESPONSE: That's not the point. The only thing that matters is whether you accept our terms or not. 
HUMAN: What if I don't? 
RESPONSE: You'll have to reimburse. Or we'll take this city by force. 
HUMAN: I could have you arrested on the spot for saying that. 
RESPONSE: Are you listening to me? Whether it's me, or someone else you're having this conversation with... Is irrelevant. And if I'm compromised... So are you. One thing's for certain, though. We will take our share. Through you, or someone else. 
HUMAN: Well, we'll see about that. In any case... I'll need some time to think this over. 
RESPONSE: You have until six o'clock. Thank you for your time. 

HUMAN: Atlas... 
RESPONSE: Hm? 
HUMAN: Is there something you'd like to tell me? 
RESPONSE: What are you talking about? 
HUMAN: Jesus... Do you think I'm stupid? 
RESPONSE: Of course not. 
HUMAN: Then how about you tell me what the fuck's going on? We're not going to that dam, are we? 
RESPONSE: That's right. 
HUMAN: So... Where are we going? 
RESPONSE: Calpoli. 
HUMAN: Huh? Why? 
RESPONSE: Because the entire thing with Fredrick Dam is nothing but a hoax. And I won't let you die for something stupid like that. 
HUMAN: Thanks, I guess... But that doesn't answer my question. 
RESPONSE: Right. The reason we're going to Calpoli... Is because it's the least guarded checkpoint of our border to Amryn. 
HUMAN: So what are we supposed to do there? 
RESPONSE: Nothing. Unless you want to. 
HUMAN: Atlas... Stop speaking in riddles, already! 
RESPONSE: I know you want to run away. Hell, I think everybody does, at this point. 
HUMAN: So that's what it's all about? You want to get me out? 
RESPONSE: Of course not. That's why I said... It's up to you. 

HUMAN: Are we just gonna stare at each other the entire trip? 
RESPONSE: You feel like there's something we should talk about? 
HUMAN: I'm not sure. But the silence is killing me. 
RESPONSE: We're almost there. 
HUMAN: Yeah... So... Have you made up your mind, yet? 
RESPONSE: Nope. 
HUMAN: Sometimes you really are an idiot. 
RESPONSE: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: Who are you doing this for? 
RESPONSE: I'm doing this for me. Because if I didn't... I'd hate myself. 
HUMAN: So you're guilt-tripping yourself into this? 
RESPONSE: Is that a bad thing? 
HUMAN: I'm not one to judge. Thanks, though. 
RESPONSE: For what? 
HUMAN: For being honest with me. 
RESPONSE: Whatever you say... 
HUMAN: In any case... I'm grateful. Because you trying to prove a point... Means I get to spend more time with you. 
RESPONSE: You really are something else... 
HUMAN: Looks like we're there. So what's it gonna be, Atlas? Who is it? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Are we just gonna stare at each other the entire trip? 
RESPONSE: You feel like there's something we should talk about? 
HUMAN: I'm not sure. But the silence is killing me. 
RESPONSE: We're almost there. 
HUMAN: Yeah... So... Have you made up your mind, yet? 
RESPONSE: Nope. 
HUMAN: Sometimes you really are an idiot. 
RESPONSE: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: Who are you doing this for? 
RESPONSE: I'm doing this for me. Because if I didn't... I'd hate myself. 
HUMAN: So you're guilt-tripping yourself into this? 
RESPONSE: Is that a bad thing? 
HUMAN: I'm not one to judge. Thanks, though. 
RESPONSE: For what? 
HUMAN: For being honest with me. 
RESPONSE: Whatever you say... 
HUMAN: In any case... I'm grateful. Because you trying to prove a point... Means I get to spend more time with you. 
RESPONSE: You really are something else... 

HUMAN: Say, I have a question. 
RESPONSE: ... 
HUMAN: You could at least look at me, you know. 
RESPONSE: ... 
HUMAN: Was that so hard? 
RESPONSE: I thought you wanted to ask me something. 
HUMAN: Does she know about our little trip? 
RESPONSE: Not yet. 
HUMAN: What do you mean by that? 
RESPONSE: She will find out, eventually. 
HUMAN: Won't she be worried? Last time we spoke.... Didn't go very well. I'd hate for her to be kept in the dark for too long. And yeah, I know... It's safer if she doesn't know. 
RESPONSE: That's not the primary reason. Your sister is more than able to take care of herself, I have no doubt about that. 
HUMAN: Why keep it from her, then? 
RESPONSE: You of all people should know... That she'd never let you go. Not because her career and life are on the line. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't really care about herself a lot. But you, on the other hand? She would give everything just to keep you safe. 
HUMAN: That doesn't make sense. There's no way I would have let her stop me. 
RESPONSE: I doubt any of us would have been able to. But as I said... She's prepared to take the fall for you. The place you're headed, however... She won't be able to protect you there. 
HUMAN: The sheer arrogance... 
RESPONSE: You can't really blame her. After all, you are a bit of a troublemaker. 
HUMAN: I'm sorry. But there's people who won't accept tyranny. No matter what it calls itself. I don't know how you can bear it. But I guess every trait has it's value at some point. 
RESPONSE: I'll take that as a compliment. 
HUMAN: You should. 
RESPONSE: I can't help it. I owe it to Eury. 
HUMAN: It always come back to her, doesn't it? 
RESPONSE: Not for much longer. Once you've crossed the border, you'll have to become a different person entirely. 
HUMAN: I know. It's a one-way trip... 
RESPONSE: You can still turn back, you know? 
HUMAN: Nope. I've made up my mind. Besides, you never know... Perhaps one day I'll return. 
RESPONSE: You'd put all of us in danger. 
HUMAN: That's not what I mean. I am talking about an Ionia that is free. And I know you can see it, too. You and my sister can go on and on about duty as much as you like. But both of you have long realized that you're playing a farce. This system can't be changed from the top. Not behind closed doors. And not on the whim of a man whose only redeeming quality is to be victor of a power struggle. 
RESPONSE: We've been over that a thousand times already. You were talking about values earlier, remember? There's value in recognizing that you've lost. In the end, we're just trying to survive. There's no point in sacking yourself just on the off chance that someone else might feel bad. And besides... Why would you destroy a world in which you thrive? Don't get me wrong. I'm not enjoying this. I can see the fear in their eyes once they realize who I'm working for. And I've had to do terrible things to people I held dear. But I'm a coward, you see... Take this profession away from me and I'd be nothing. I can work people, because I know they're weak. But in truth, I think I'm the weakest of all of them. They've made a terrible choice once or twice in their life. And we make the ones to make sure that these missteps will continue to haunt them. But me? I've got nothing to lose. Because they made me this way. There's nowhere for me to go but forward, you see? 
HUMAN: You really are a dumbo, sometimes. How about... Instead of blindly waltzing forward like a machine... You just go wherever the hell you want? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: I think this is it. 
RESPONSE: ... 
HUMAN: Time to make up your mind. So... What's it gonna be? Damn, you really are indecisive. 
RESPONSE: What tells you that I haven't made up my mind already, long ago? 
HUMAN: Well, if that's the case... Would you mind sharing it with me, then? Who is it? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Sorry about the disturbance. Would you mind showing me your identification, please? 
HUMAN: Of course! Can never be to sure in these trying times, eh? 
HUMAN: Hm... I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me. 
RESPONSE: Are you sure about that? 
HUMAN: And who are you? 
RESPONSE: I'm in charge of her. 
HUMAN: Yes, I've been informed of that. 
RESPONSE: So? 
HUMAN: You need to come with me as well. Be advised that I am instructed to use force, if necessary. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Hm? Yo! I was just on my way back. Did you hear it, too? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Something must've happened at the checkpoint. 
HUMAN: How do you know? 
RESPONSE: Our deal in Nestville. 
HUMAN: Oh! Right. 
RESPONSE: And you? Did you find anything? 
HUMAN: Nope. I followed the guy to the OA. But lost him there. 
RESPONSE: Hm. 
HUMAN: What's wrong? 
RESPONSE: Just wondering... Daphne told me she gave you something. 
HUMAN: Shit! I totally forgot about that. 
RESPONSE: You still have it? 
HUMAN: Yeah, right here. 
RESPONSE: Open it. 
HUMAN: You sure? 
RESPONSE: I can do it, if you don't want to. 
HUMAN: It's fine. I'll do it. Let's see... Hm? It's... empty? 
RESPONSE: Figures. 
HUMAN: I don't get it. 
RESPONSE: She's testing you, Ganymede. I've got a question for you. When you fell into the sewers, last night... Was that planned? 
HUMAN: Excuse me? 
RESPONSE: You were pushed, weren't you? Ganymede? 
HUMAN: Accidents happen. 
RESPONSE: Triumvirate entrance confirmed. That's what the message said. 
HUMAN: Amryn knows we're here? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Someone told them, Ganymede. 
HUMAN: And you think it's her? 
RESPONSE: Maybe. 
HUMAN: Why? 
RESPONSE: Me and her... Know each other. 
HUMAN: Huh? 
RESPONSE: I took something away from her. A long time ago. 
HUMAN: So? 
RESPONSE: If shit hits the fan... I might as well not just go back. Now, Ganymede... I'll give you something special. A choice. I don't expect you to trust me. So I'll show it to you. 
HUMAN: Show me what? 
RESPONSE: Daphne. Let's go. 
HUMAN: Where to? 
RESPONSE: Trenton Plaza. 

HUMAN: How would I know? 
RESPONSE: Because of who you're working for. 
HUMAN: If you're implying that it's me... 
RESPONSE: That's not what I meant. Between the three of us, you're the outsider. And you've been out cold the entire morning, let's not forget. 

HUMAN: East: Eastern Checkpoint South: Old Admirality West: Hudsman Corner 
RESPONSE: We should finish our business here, first. 

HUMAN: I'm sorry sir, no entry. 
RESPONSE: We have an appointment with Mr. Werter. Here's our invitation. 
HUMAN: Oh, I see. I'll open the gates for you. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Dorothy? Dotty! 
HUMAN: Hm? √Åron? Sorry... 
RESPONSE: It's okay. Are you alright? 
HUMAN: I guess... 
RESPONSE: Did they hurt you? 
HUMAN: No... Not really. 
RESPONSE: But? 
HUMAN: There was this guy, earlier... 
RESPONSE: What did he do? 
HUMAN: Just a couple of questions about Dad... He's done something bad, hasn't he? Is that why you're here? 
RESPONSE: Yeah... 
HUMAN: Okay... 
RESPONSE: Don't worry. I'm not here to question you. On the contrary... I'm the one who's got a confession to make. 

HUMAN: Atlas? Yo! Uhm... Everything okay? 
RESPONSE: Your face... 
HUMAN: Tanner got a bit overexcited. 
RESPONSE: Sorry to hear that. 
HUMAN: It's okay. Not that I mind... But are you sure meeting like this is a good idea? 
RESPONSE: The more obvious the better. We're at war now. 
HUMAN: Shit. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry. We're ready. Thanks to you. 
HUMAN: Glad it was worth it. 
RESPONSE: For the record... It wasn't my- 
HUMAN: I know, Atlas... I know. 
RESPONSE: Good. Anyways... We better get going. 
HUMAN: Where to? 
RESPONSE: Elysian. 
HUMAN: The safehouse? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Let's go. 

HUMAN: It's been three days, already, hm. 
RESPONSE: Feels like yesterday. 
HUMAN: Yeah. Before we go... There's something I've got to tell you. 
RESPONSE: It can't wait? 
HUMAN: Sorry. But I already waited eight agonizing years. You know that I love you, right? 
RESPONSE: How would I know? 
HUMAN: You never asked yourself why I'm so fiercely loyal to you? 
RESPONSE: Because it's part of your job? 
HUMAN: I'm serious, Atlas. 
RESPONSE: Sorry. But I don't believe it. 
HUMAN: You think I'd make this up? 
RESPONSE: I'm not questioning your love... But your loyalty. 
HUMAN: Right. Very good, actually. Let me rephrase the question, then. Why do you think I haven't killed you, yet? 
RESPONSE: Do you want to kill me? 
HUMAN: It's only natural, I think. 
RESPONSE: Because of what I did to Daniil? 
HUMAN: And because you sold me and my mother out. 
RESPONSE: If it's an apology you want- 
HUMAN: Don't make me laugh. We've been through all that a thousand times, already. I don't want another apology. I want you to know the truth. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: It's been three days, already, hm. 
RESPONSE: Feels like yesterday. 
HUMAN: Yeah. Before we go... There's something I've got to tell you. 
RESPONSE: It can't wait? 
HUMAN: Sorry. But I already waited eight agonizing years. You know that I love you, right? 
RESPONSE: How would I know? 
HUMAN: You never asked yourself why I'm so fiercely loyal to you? 
RESPONSE: Because it's part of your job? 
HUMAN: I'm serious, Atlas. 
RESPONSE: Sorry. But I don't believe it. 
HUMAN: You think I'd make this up? 
RESPONSE: I'm not questioning your love... But your loyalty. 
HUMAN: Right. Very good, actually. Let me rephrase the question, then. Why do you think I haven't killed you, yet? 
RESPONSE: Do you want to kill me? 
HUMAN: It's only natural, I think. 
RESPONSE: Because of what I did to Daniil? 
HUMAN: And because you sold me and my mother out. 
RESPONSE: If it's an apology you want- 
HUMAN: Don't make me laugh. We've been through all that a thousand times, already. I don't want another apology. I want you to know the truth. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: No turning back now. 

HUMAN: We need to talk. 
HUMAN: Is that so? 
HUMAN: That Tillian guy you sent with us. He's one of Amryn's people. 
HUMAN: What? Why would you think that? 
RESPONSE: Because it's true. 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: Tell me... Was it you? 
HUMAN: I don't know what you're talking about. 
RESPONSE: Cut the bullshit! You told Eury about arteria, didn't you? 
HUMAN: Of course I did. Just like you ordered me to. 
RESPONSE: Right. Somehow, this information ended up with Amryn. Now, how did that happen, I wonder? 
HUMAN: I'm sure you'll tell me in a second. 
RESPONSE: As it stands, there are two possibilities. They either got it from Eury... Or you. So? Which do you think it is? 
HUMAN: Hm. I'm quite baffled that you of all people would ask me that question. Seeing as you were the one who brought her to me. 
RESPONSE: To watch her, yeah. Tell me, then... Where is she? 

HUMAN: Would you mind explaining yourself? 
RESPONSE: Sorry, Daph. But I had to make sure. 
HUMAN: Stop speaking in riddles, already. 
RESPONSE: You asked me why I didn't turn Eury in, right? n<AtlasIt's true. I have to protect her. But not from us. Pravoskos told you, didn't he? We needed to put up a show for Eury. So she could get close to Lorentz. 
HUMAN: And? Did she find him? 
RESPONSE: Not yet. But they've set up a meeting. 
HUMAN: Where? 
RESPONSE: I don't know, yet. 
HUMAN: And you think he's really here? 
RESPONSE: He has to be. His fingerprints are all over Amryn's movements Including Ganymede. 
HUMAN: Yeah. You were right about him. 
RESPONSE: He really was working for Lorentz, then? 
HUMAN: All the signs are pointing to it. 
RESPONSE: A shame. He's a very bright young man. 
HUMAN: Some people can't be trusted, I guess. 
RESPONSE: Right. You want to send him back? 
HUMAN: Yeah. It was fun, while it lasted... But I already got what I wanted from him. 
RESPONSE: Alright. I'll file the papers once we get back. 
HUMAN: Okay. Something still bothers me, though. 
RESPONSE: What? 
HUMAN: I don't know... It just feels like I don't know who to trust, anymore. 
RESPONSE: Welcome to my world. The bad news is, you'll never get used to| it. But we can try, at least. Looks like they're ready. You want to see this? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Let's get it over with. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Would you mind explaining yourself? 
RESPONSE: Sorry, Daph. But I had to make sure. 
HUMAN: Stop speaking in riddles, already. 
RESPONSE: You asked me why I didn't turn Eury in, right? n<AtlasIt's true. I have to protect her. But not from us. Pravoskos told you, didn't he? We needed to put up a show for Eury. So she could get close to Lorentz. 
HUMAN: And? Did she find him? 
RESPONSE: Not yet. But they've set up a meeting. 
HUMAN: Where? 
RESPONSE: An appartment in Stuart Alley. 
HUMAN: And you think he's really here? 
RESPONSE: He has to be. His fingerprints are all over Amryn's movements Including Ganymede. 
HUMAN: Yeah. You were right about him. 
RESPONSE: He really was working for Lorentz, then? 
HUMAN: All the signs are pointing to it. 
RESPONSE: A shame. He's a very bright young man. 
HUMAN: Some people can't be trusted, I guess. 
RESPONSE: Right. You want to send him back? 
HUMAN: Yeah. It was fun, while it lasted... But I already got what I wanted from him.

RESPONSE: What? 
HUMAN: I don't know... It just feels like I don't know who to trust, anymore. 
RESPONSE: Welcome to my world. The bad news is, you'll never get used to| it. But we can try, at least. Looks like they're ready. You want to see this? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Let's get it over with. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: And I'm telling you that you can't trust these guys. You know what they did to that one guy they arrested, right? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: This should be it. Hm... Looks like he's not in, yet. 
HUMAN: Hey! You need something from the Colonel? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
HUMAN: Well, tough luck. He left like an hour ago. 
HUMAN: Damn. 
HUMAN: Say, have we met before? 
HUMAN: Not that I can think of. 
HUMAN: Hm... Might just be my mind playing tricks on me, then. In any case... I'm Herbert. 
HUMAN: Theodore. 
HUMAN: You want me to relay a message to the Colonel? 
HUMAN: Thanks, but it's fine. I don't mind waiting. 
HUMAN: Alright. I'll get back to work, then. 
HUMAN: Don't let me keep you. 
HUMAN: Was nice meeting you, Theodore. I totally forgot! I'm terribly sorry... But we've been having an influx on new people, lately. So the Colonel asked me to conduct a check on all the personnel. 
HUMAN: Oh? 
HUMAN: Would you mind showing me your identification, real quick? 
HUMAN: Not at all. 
HUMAN: Thank you. Let's see... Theodore Harrington... Wait a second... Are you related to Freddy? 
HUMAN: Freddy? 
HUMAN: Frederick Harrington. Tall, blonde guy. 
HUMAN: Oh! No, I don't think so. At the very least, I never met him. 
HUMAN: Oh, okay then. You're from Trachi proper? 
HUMAN: Born and raised. 
HUMAN: Uh-huh. That's quite curious. 
HUMAN: How so? 
HUMAN: Well, your accent reminds me a bit of the countryside. 
HUMAN: Is that so? The truth is... Both of my parents are from Verin. They moved here a few years before I was born. 
HUMAN: Oh! That explains it. Hm... When were these papers issued? 
HUMAN: Uhh... I don't remember the exact date. But it must've been a week, or two ago. 
HUMAN: Hmm. I might be wrong... But looks like the identification is based on an old numbering system. I'm sorry, but I'll have to check up on this. 
HUMAN: Of course. 
HUMAN: Would you come with me, please? 
HUMAN: Well... I'm not sure the Colonel would appreciate my report being delayed. 
HUMAN: No need to worry about that. Should just take a moment. 
HUMAN: Alright... If you insist. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: You really think that's going to work? 
RESPONSE: Sorry. Old habits die hard, I guess. 
HUMAN: Come on, Atlas. I know you're tired and all. But I really can't take it anymore! 
RESPONSE: Right. Let's get this over with. 

HUMAN: HEY! 
RESPONSE: Hm? 
HUMAN: You okay? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. Just... memories. 
HUMAN: Right. 
RESPONSE: Are we ready? 
HUMAN: Yup. We got him cornered. The kill is yours. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Let's finish this. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: No turning back now. 

HUMAN: Back in the sewers. 
RESPONSE: You going to be alright? 
HUMAN: Yeah. Where are we headed? 
RESPONSE: Eastwards. Just follow the trail until we're at the end. 
HUMAN: Alright. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: It's west of here. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Watch your step. 
HUMAN: How much further? 
RESPONSE: Almost there. 
HUMAN: Gany! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Wait. 
HUMAN: What's wrong? 
RESPONSE: There should be a patrol passing through here, any minute. See that door to your right? There's a maintenance area in there. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We should finish our business here, first. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Let's talk to him later. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: No time to waste. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: No need to intrude. 

HUMAN: Sorry to keep the two of you waiting. He put up way more resistance than I thought. 
RESPONSE: Don't worry about it. How is he? 
HUMAN: Sleeping like a baby! 
RESPONSE: Good. 
HUMAN: There's one thing that worries me, though. 
RESPONSE: What? 
HUMAN: I checked for his keys... But they were gone, already. 
HUMAN: Shit. Atlas? 
RESPONSE: You got your own set of keys with you? 
HUMAN: Of course! 
RESPONSE: Good. Let's not waste any more time, then. 
HUMAN: You know your way through the sewers? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. I've taken that route a few times, before. 
HUMAN: Okay. I'll stay here and keep an eye on Drenem. Good luck to you! 
RESPONSE: Thanks. For everything. 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. I'm just doing my job! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We've got no time to waste. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: What's wrong? 
HUMAN: Nothing. 
RESPONSE: You sure? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE: Okay. 
HUMAN: Atlas... 
RESPONSE: Yeah? 
HUMAN: Are you absolutely sure this'll work? 
RESPONSE: What do you mean? 
HUMAN: Holding onto something for that long... You know how they are. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. If you want me to go, instead... I'll do it. 
HUMAN: That's no good. Your boss wouldn't let you go. Not for anything in the world. No. It's gotta be me. 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry, Gany. If you want out... I won't hold it against you. 
HUMAN: Don't mock me, please. I'd never forgive myself. And you know that. 
RESPONSE: I wish there was a way I could make it easier on you. 
HUMAN: You can, actually... 
RESPONSE: Tell me. 
HUMAN: Well... Give me a reason to hold out. Make it worth it. 
RESPONSE: I'll try my best. 
HUMAN: That's not what I mean. At this point... You probably figured out how I work. And what drives me. I fall in love with things. Or people. Because I want to make them mine. I cannot resist it. And I'll always be a victim to these feelings. I've thought about it time and time again. But I always end up at the same conclusion. Atlas... I'll have to fall in love with you. 
RESPONSE: Gany... 
HUMAN: I know. 
RESPONSE: What do you want me to do? 
HUMAN: I was briefed on you, you know... Not the full story, of course. But I know there was a girl. She was more important to you than anything else in the world. So tell me... What was she like? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: And that's the gist of it. 
HUMAN: Okay. That explains a lot. But to be frank... I didn't expect you to have a side like this. 
RESPONSE: Sorry to burst your bubble. But I'm only human, after all. 
HUMAN: Don't worry about it. I think it's adorable in some way. And I can definitely emphasize with it. It'll do. 
RESPONSE: Is that a yes? 
HUMAN: Yup. I'll try! No promises, though. The moment shit hits the fan- 
RESPONSE: You'll give them Fero. 
HUMAN: And if that doesn't help? 
RESPONSE: You'll tell them about Hermingrad. 
HUMAN: Good. 
RESPONSE: As for the other thing... 
HUMAN: Sorry. But I insist. 
RESPONSE: Why do you care about her in the first place? 
HUMAN: If you were in my spot... Wouldn't you want the same? 
RESPONSE: That's different. 
HUMAN: I don't think so. As far as I can see it... It's what she does. 
RESPONSE: Maybe. Or maybe you just want to keep things pretty... Before you smash them to bits. 
HUMAN: You're really something else, Atlas. It's like you're incredibly clever... But also insurmountably stupid, at the same time. Or "maybe" it's just me not seeing you straight. In any case. You're in it for the madness. Whether you like it, or not. There's something special about being in control. Right? 
RESPONSE: Hm. It's working? 
HUMAN: Somewhat, yeah. But I think I'm getting there. 
RESPONSE: Okay. It's about time I got underway. 
HUMAN: Yeah. Me too. 
RESPONSE: Good luck. 
HUMAN: Likewise. √Åron. 
RESPONSE: Speak for yourself. But I for one don't give a shit about who you are. Because the only thing I see in front of me... Is a child. 
HUMAN: Keep it coming. 
RESPONSE: Everywhere you go... You need to be center of attention. A life directed towards submission. But never the happy servant for very long. And so you drag yourself from high to low... Hoping to find something. Or someone. To latch onto forever. It's your sickness. And your addiction. If it weren't for someone pulling your strings... You'd have no idea where to go. Isn't that right? Timo? 
HUMAN: Bravo. I mean it. Thanks! 
RESPONSE: For being honest with you? 
HUMAN: You know what... One day I'll kill you. 
RESPONSE: Feel free to try. But for now... It's mutual assured destruction. 
HUMAN: Solid finish. Alright. Let's do this. 
RESPONSE: Right. See you in a few. 
HUMAN: See you in a few. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Nothing for us up there. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Any minute, now. 
HUMAN: Why didn't you tell us? 
RESPONSE: Because it doesn't matter. If Solka's dealt with... Ionia will be gone from this place in a few hours. 
HUMAN: Are you sure about that? 
RESPONSE: One hundred percent. Their colonel is on leave. And no one's left to lead his troops into battle. 
HUMAN: I do hope you're right. What about your associates? 
RESPONSE: One of them's already compromised. The other one... Will hardly be able to do anything on her own. In other words... It's over. 

HUMAN: Lorna? 
RESPONSE: Sorry, Eury. I didn't know you were home, already. 
HUMAN: I can imagine. So? Why are you here? 
RESPONSE: There's a few things I need to get rid of. It won't take long, I promise. 
HUMAN: So that's how it is. Just cleaning up, hm? 
RESPONSE: Sorry. But it's in your interest, too. 
HUMAN: The sheer guts on you. If it wasn't for her... I'd kill you just for that. 
RESPONSE: If that makes you happy. Go ahead. But I'm in a bit of a rush, you see. So if you really want to do it... Do it now. I thought as much. 

HUMAN: If you think I'd let you touch anything in that room- 
RESPONSE: I'm sorry, but I have to. 
HUMAN: Give me the list. I'll do it. 
RESPONSE: Can I trust you? 
HUMAN: You said it yourself. My life is on the line, as well. 
RESPONSE: Alright. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Make sure to burn everything. 
HUMAN: Thank you. But as you might remember... I've done these kind of things before. 
RESPONSE: Right, sorry. Feels like it's been ages since- 
HUMAN: Listen Atlas. There's nothing for us to say to each other. Ever again. 
RESPONSE: Okay. Farewell, Eury. 
HUMAN: You too... √Åron. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Where the hell have you been? 
RESPONSE: You've heard the news? 
HUMAN: Yeah. The sheer guts on you... Showing yourself here. 
RESPONSE: I had to. Don't you agree? 
HUMAN: So... Are you proud of yourself? 
RESPONSE: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: You've finally taken her from me. And now... You can't even give her back anymore. 
RESPONSE: Eury... 
HUMAN: Did you even realize... She loved you, damn it! And I trusted you, as well. Answer me one thing, Atlas. Was the entire thing your idea? Did you think you could just run off with her? Or did you just her as a footnote in your CV? What was it, Atlas? 
RESPONSE: You know I cannot talk about that. 
HUMAN: How convenient! You've always been a tool. But the one time you make a choice... You get my little sister killed. 
RESPONSE: I am sorry. Beyond all measure. Lorna was very dear to me. 
HUMAN: And that's what makes it really sting... You've got nothing else to say? 
RESPONSE: There's a lot of things... But I don't think it's gonna change anything. The only reason why I'm here is because I owe it to you and her. 
HUMAN: You say that, but you can't even tell me truth. Then again... It's all the same to you, isn't it? I always knew it. Deep down, you don't care about anybody but yourself. Lorna refused to believe it. And so she died for you. Get out. And for your sake... Hope that the two of us never meet again. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Look who it is. 
RESPONSE: You've heard the news? 
HUMAN: Yeah. The sheer guts on you... Showing yourself here. 
RESPONSE: I had to. Don't you agree? 
HUMAN: So... Are you proud of yourself? 
RESPONSE: What do you mean by that? 
HUMAN: You've finally taken her from me. And now... You can't even give her back anymore. 
RESPONSE: Eury... 
HUMAN: Did you even realize... She loved you, damn it! And I trusted you, as well. Answer me one thing, Atlas. Was the entire thing your idea? Did you think you could just run off with her? Or did you just her as a footnote in your CV? What was it, Atlas? 
RESPONSE: You know I cannot talk about that. 
HUMAN: How convenient! You've always been a tool. But the one time you make a choice... You get my little sister killed. 
RESPONSE: I am sorry. Beyond all measure. Lorna was very dear to me. 
HUMAN: And that's what makes it really sting... You've got nothing else to say? 
RESPONSE: There's a lot of things... But I don't think it's gonna change anything. The only reason why I'm here is because I owe it to you and her. 
HUMAN: You say that, but you can't even tell me truth. Then again... It's all the same to you, isn't it? I always knew it. Deep down, you don't care about anybody but yourself. Lorna refused to believe it. And so she died for you. Get out. And for your sake... Hope that the two of us never meet again. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: How about we skip that part and get to it? 
HUMAN: You don't make the rules here. 
RESPONSE: True. But you are aware that you can't work me like this, right? 
HUMAN: Whatever you say. So... That girl you were travelling with. 
RESPONSE: She's my associate. 
HUMAN: Indeed. However, you were not travelling in on official business, were you? 
RESPONSE: I'm afraid that's classified. 
HUMAN: That's irrelevant. You are obligated to share with me all details of your itinerary. 
RESPONSE: Has this been cleared with my CO? 
HUMAN: That's none of your concern. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Have it your way, then. But until I see something official, I can't share any details with you. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You're kidding me. 
HUMAN: I wish I was. But I'm afraid the situation is far too dire for that. 
RESPONSE: What did you do to her? 
HUMAN: I merely explained to her the ramifications of this incident. On each and everyone of us. 
RESPONSE: Did you mention that the entire thing was your idea, too? 
HUMAN: Of course I didn't. But if you want, I'll go and tell her right now. I'm sure the interrogators would love to get that out of her, as well. 
RESPONSE: Let me speak to her, then. 
HUMAN: You know that's impossible. I already took a huge risk coming here. There's no way I'll let you endanger everything. 
RESPONSE: Always looking out for yourself, aren't you? 
HUMAN: It's for your sake, too. And Eury's. All of us are implied in a serious breach of protocol. Some might even say... Treason. Which is ridiculous, of course. You were merely investigating a case of attempted desertion within the military. The person in question being a Corporal named Lorna Farag√≥, born on the 5th May, 1897. To confirm your suspicions, you accompanied said Corporal all the way to the checkpoint near the city of Calpoli. Your investigation was interrupted by two officials of the military. Obviously they were not aware of your intentions. So they apprehended both you and Lorna. In the course of being questioned... Lorna revealed that she, in fact, intended to desert. So, even though the military acted too rashly... They are to be commended on their efforts of keeping their own troops in line. As a member of EnKAD, I am deeply troubled by the sheer audacity to abandon Ionia in such a cowardly fashion. However, I also personally believe that this incident can and should be used as an appeal to further consolidate the executive branches of Ionia. Is that agreeable to you? Atlas... She is dead, no matter what. There's nothing either of us can do to change that. We took a chance... And we lost. Lorna is willing to take the fall for us. And I know you would do the same for her. So please, I implore you... Don't let her sacrifice go in vain. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: See? I told you he'd show up. 
RESPONSE: Orpheus. 
HUMAN: Atlas. 
RESPONSE: Eury. I found your message. 
HUMAN: Good. And I'm glad you made it here. 
RESPONSE: I'd rather you skip the bullshit. And explain yourself. 
HUMAN: Straight to the point, as always. But alright. I have a question for you. Did Hyperion ever tell you who leaked your trip to the military? 
RESPONSE: I don't see what any of that has to do with it. And to be honest... I think you're stalling. 
HUMAN: You really are something else... It was me. 
RESPONSE: Was it, now? 
HUMAN: Not on purpose, of course. In fact, I just found out a few weeks ago. And only because Orpheus here told me. 
HUMAN: When I read her letter of recommendation... Two things struck me. One, her possible involvement in a false flag operation at the Fredrick Dam. And second, a note regarding a certain Lorna Farag√≥. 
RESPONSE: What did it say? 
HUMAN: A 21-year-old girl, serving in the military. A trouble-maker. And a possible defector. 
RESPONSE: What? 
HUMAN: It's curious, isn't it? But it didn't matter. Fero was very anxious about the thing with that dam. And since we knew EnKAD couldn't do that without the military... We made a few inquiries. And told the military about Lorna, in return. We put her on the map. As such, I consider myself responsible for her death. Even though I didn't know she was Eury's sister... I played my part. 
HUMAN: And so did I. I've written a lot of letters, just like this one. I should've known better. But I trusted Hyperion. 
RESPONSE: You have it with you? 
HUMAN: Yup. 
RESPONSE: Let me see it. I'll kill him. 

HUMAN: Another one, really? Well, time's a wasting! 
RESPONSE: Don't get your hopes up. 

HUMAN: Whoops! 
RESPONSE: Stop right there! 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: There's nothing left for us to do here. 

HUMAN: Another one, really? Well, time's a wasting! 
RESPONSE: Don't get your hopes up. 

HUMAN: Whoops! 
RESPONSE: Stop right there! 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: There's nothing left for us to do here. 

HUMAN: It was Solka, wasn't it? 
RESPONSE: I'm afraid we can't disclose that. 
HUMAN: I should've known. Oh well, not like it matters anymore. You've spoken to her, then? 
RESPONSE: Yes. 
HUMAN: How is she? 
RESPONSE: Good, all things considered. She's very brave for her age. 
HUMAN: I see. How much has she told you? 
RESPONSE: It's been a few years... So the details are a bit muddy. But I think you are aware that this won't dilute the plausibility of her testimony. 
HUMAN: Of course. I take it you'll use this to gain leverage on Faber, as well? 
RESPONSE: He's the patron of the orphanage. There's no way he wasn't aware of it. 
HUMAN: Hmm.. So, out with it, then. What do you want me to do? 
RESPONSE: It's pretty simple, really. From now on, we don't want any of your men bothering our agents, assets or any member affiliated with the TLF. 
HUMAN: You want them to turn a blind eye? 
RESPONSE: As you said it. Furthermore, the checkpont is to be reopened immediately and all patrols on the eastern river are to cease. 
HUMAN: Including the deployment of any defensive measures. 
HUMAN: How do you know about this? 
HUMAN: That's not important. What matters is that you'll comply. 
HUMAN: This will leave the city nigh on defenseless. 
RESPONSE: Whatever the case might be... Can you agree to these terms? 
HUMAN: Not like I have a choice. 
RESPONSE: I take it you will meet Faber later today? 
HUMAN: After his speech, yes. Don't worry, I won't breathe a word of this to him. It's in my best interest, as well. 
RESPONSE: I'm glad you see it that way, too. Alright. Just for the sake of completeness... Do we need to state what happens if you decide to go back on your word? 
HUMAN: That won't be necessary. I'm well aware of your methods. 
RESPONSE: Good. I think that concludes our negotiations. Thank you for your cooperation. We'll be in touch. Let's go. 

HUMAN: I'm not sure I understand. You want me to plan those mines? 
RESPONSE: Exactly. 
HUMAN: I fail to see how that serves your purpose. 
RESPONSE: Because there is a war at hand. And if those waters are safe, you'll have the Ionian Navy right on your doorstep. 
HUMAN: I get that. What I don't understand is your angle. You've more or less won already. 
RESPONSE: That remains to be seen. 
HUMAN: Well, whatever the case... I'm guessing Faber won't be against the idea, considering the circumstances. So you can consider it done. 
RESPONSE: Good. There is more. 
HUMAN: What a surprise. 
RESPONSE: I'll pay you another visit, later today. 
HUMAN: Are you insane? 
RESPONSE: It's necessary, I'm afraid. One of my associates will be accompanying me. 
HUMAN: To what end? 
RESPONSE: That we're on the same page. 
HUMAN: I don't get it. 
RESPONSE: Contrary to what we've discussed here... We'll ask you to stop any deployment of the mines. 
HUMAN: Oh! So it's like that, hm? You're a double agent! 
RESPONSE: Whatever you might think. This conversation here... Never took place. 
HUMAN: Wow. You really are something else. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Looks like they left their clothes here. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Daph? 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: Sorry I'm late. 
HUMAN: Yeah, about that... Care to tell me where the fuck you've been? 
RESPONSE: It's a long story. And we don't have a lot of time. 
HUMAN: Right. So... What did he say? 
RESPONSE: It's true. Orpheus is here. 
HUMAN: The thing with Solka... Was that him? 
RESPONSE: According to Sternlein, yeah. They pressured him into suicide. 
HUMAN: Damn. 
RESPONSE: How's the situation at the OA? 
HUMAN: I wish I could tell you. But I spent the entire night working Gany. 
RESPONSE: I see. What did he tell you? 
HUMAN: Not much. A few things about Fero. The usual tripe about how you're trying to backstab us. 
RESPONSE: Hm. 
HUMAN: Oh, and one more thing. 
RESPONSE: Yeah? 
HUMAN: He met Orpheus, a few months ago, apparently. Random chance. 
RESPONSE: That explains a lot. 
HUMAN: Yeah. It's got to be him. 
RESPONSE: You know... It's been a while since the two of us did something together. 
HUMAN: Not like I had much of a choice. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. And I'm sorry about that. But if you're up for it... We'll pay De Bloom a visit. 
HUMAN: Huh? Why? 
RESPONSE: I've got a few questions for him. About that Tillian guy he sent with us. And after we're done with him... We'll go and see Ganymede. 
HUMAN: To be honest... I was a bit worried that you've grown soft. But now that you've got me all worked up... You better take responsibility. 
RESPONSE: Isn't that what I've been doing, the entire time? 
HUMAN: You know how it is. It's the climax that counts! 
RESPONSE: Right. Let's go. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Welcome back. 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: Daphne. How's your back? 
HUMAN: Hurts like hell. 
RESPONSE: They got the bullet out. One of your kidneys, though... Let's just say I wouldn't rely on it, if I were you. 
HUMAN: Funny... I wanted to say the same thing about you. 
RESPONSE: You brought this on yourself, you know. 
HUMAN: Yeah. By trusting you, for starters. So? What's the verdict? 
RESPONSE: Well... Eury is dead, thanks to you. 
HUMAN: For the record... That one wasn't planned. 
RESPONSE: If you say so. 
HUMAN: If she hadn't- 
RESPONSE: You pulled that trigger, Daph. And there's no way to ever take that back. 
HUMAN: Look who's talking. 
RESPONSE: That's exactly my point. So unless you want to become like me... You better start living with yourself. 
HUMAN: Honestly, Atlas... Cry me a fucking river. 
RESPONSE: There'll be time for that, don't worry. But first... I've got to deal with you. 
HUMAN: Oh, I'm sorry. Why don't you get the fuck on with it, then? 
RESPONSE: Ariadne and Ganymede. That was you, wasn't it? 
HUMAN: Indirectly, yeah. 
RESPONSE: Congratulations. 
HUMAN: Thanks. But I really didn't do that much. 
RESPONSE: On the contrary. Ganymede's already across the border. Coupled with Icarus being KIA... That's three CoExA agents dead and one in custody. 
HUMAN: Not a bad yield for three days. 
RESPONSE: Yeah. I bet Hyperion will be very proud of you. 
HUMAN: And you? 
RESPONSE: A bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, I'd very much like to strangle you, right now. But then again... I won't need to worry about abusing you, ever again. 
HUMAN: Adorable. A shame you've got to trade me in for Gany, so soon. 
RESPONSE: We won't. 
HUMAN: Huh? 
RESPONSE: Gany's staying. 
HUMAN: Orpheus knows about this? 
RESPONSE: Yup. 
HUMAN: He's gonna let his own brother rot away in Ionia? 
RESPONSE: If that's how you like to see it. 
HUMAN: Wow. I always knew you were a sadistic piece of shit. But this takes the bloody cake! 
RESPONSE: Don't misunderstand me. When I said I'd abuse you... I didn't mean emotionally. Not like I wouldn't enjoy it, of course. But ultimately... Someone needs to keep a watch on our friend. 
HUMAN: Ganymede's a plant, isn't he? 
RESPONSE: That's right. 
HUMAN: Why? 
RESPONSE: To cover you. And the story you'll tell them. 
HUMAN: Alright. Let's hear it. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: You're out of your mind if you think I'm helping you with that! 
RESPONSE: It's up to you, ultimately. 
HUMAN: But? 
RESPONSE: Hermingrad. 
HUMAN: Atlas... You promised! 
RESPONSE: As I said... No more qualms. You hurt me, Daph. And you broke my trust. So from now on... You're nothing but a chess piece to me. I will use you. And abuse you. Until there's nothing left of you but dust. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: You okay? 
HUMAN: Yeah. 
RESPONSE: Good. Want to go first? 
HUMAN: Mhm. Just... Give me a second. 
RESPONSE: Take your time. 

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: Do yourself a favour. Don't rush it. 

HUMAN: Good day to you! How may I help? 
RESPONSE: I'd like to inquire about the status of a request me and my companions filed earlier. 
HUMAN: Certainly! Your name, if you'd be so kind? 
RESPONSE: Julius Gaston. 
HUMAN: Let's see... There doesn't seem to be anything here. I'll be right back. I'm afraid there's no record of any requests under that name. Are you sure that you were the one who filed it? 
RESPONSE: Absolutely. Thank you for the effort, anyway. 
HUMAN: Wait, please! It's a long shot... But I could check the archives, if you want. We've had a lot of commotion lately and might have put it there by accident. 
RESPONSE: That would be very forthcoming, thank you. 
HUMAN: I'll be right back! Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any sign of the request there, either... I'm very sorry! 
RESPONSE: There's no need. Thank you, once more, for your dedication. Have a nice day. 
HUMAN: Y-you too! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Salutations, Mister! How can I help you? 
RESPONSE: We've been told we'd need a visa to enter Trachi. 
HUMAN: Quite right! If you're not a citizen, that is! I just need each of you to fill out these forms here and here... Coupled with appendices 4 and 5. 
HUMAN: All thirteen pages? 
HUMAN: As you said it. Feel free to take a seat over there, if you want. Fifteen minutes later... 
HUMAN: Were you ever convicted? "What does the insignia of Trachi depict?" "Underscore the prime numbers in the following list." Is there a system to these questions, at all? 
HUMAN: Apart from trying to provoke a killing spree, you mean? 
HUMAN: It's deliberate, isn't it? 
RESPONSE: You saw the queue at the gates, didn't you? 
HUMAN: So they're trying to filtering people with this? 
RESPONSE: And delay the others. 
HUMAN: Why? 
RESPONSE: Beats me. 
HUMAN: If they shut the gates... They'd violate the treaty, right? 
RESPONSE: Correct. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions. Let's focus on the task ahead. Half an hour later... 
HUMAN: Permission to speak. 
RESPONSE: If you have to. 
HUMAN: As soon as we're inside the city... I'll find the clerk responsible for this questionnaire. And once I do... I'll take his stupid forms and shove them so far up his bureaucratic b- 
RESPONSE: You've made your point. 
HUMAN: If they're so keen on cooperating, why pull a stunt like this? 
RESPONSE: Either way, musing on it won't help. Another fifteen minutes pass... 
HUMAN: I feel personally violated. 
HUMAN: And utterly exhausted, at that. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Hello again! 
RESPONSE: There you go. 
HUMAN: Wonderful! 
RESPONSE: We're a bit short on time, I'm afraid... And would really appreciate if there are no further delays. 
HUMAN: Apologies for the inconvenience. Verification should only take a moment. Sorry for the delay! Mr. Angelov was it? 
RESPONSE: Right. 
HUMAN: Born on the 7th September, 1894 in Mavrochori? 
RESPONSE: Exactly. 
HUMAN: I'm afraid there's a problem. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Wakey wakey! 
HUMAN: ... Daph? 
HUMAN: I missed you. How are you holding up? 
HUMAN: I'm not sure what kind of answer you're expecting. But I'm alright, I guess. 
HUMAN: Glad to hear it. 
HUMAN: So? What's on the menu? 
HUMAN: Well, I'm happy you enjoyed the appetizer. And I think we're both ready for the main course. 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: Hello, Ganymede. 
HUMAN: How nice of you to join in on the fun! Ouch... That one kinda hurt, you know. 
RESPONSE: Shut up! 
HUMAN: Or what? 
RESPONSE: For the record... I'm sorry. 
HUMAN: Nice try! But that won't work anymore. Come on Gany. Look. At him. Hello? 
HUMAN: What the fuck?! 
HUMAN: Awww. Is it getting too much for you? 
RESPONSE: Tell me. Where is he? 
HUMAN: Jesus fucking christ! How do you think I would know?! 
RESPONSE: Answer! 
HUMAN: I don't know! 
HUMAN: Three down... Seven to go. I hope you'll last through all of them. You know what comes after that, right? 
HUMAN: Steady. Breathe. Did it work? Good. Funny. Alright. Sorry for putting you through this. But for some reason, I'm dragging you into this place with me. And I think you can understand... That I'd rather be here than there, right now. But let's forget about that for a moment, okay? Because there's more important matters at hand. I was about to ask if you enjoy seeing this kind of stuff. But to be honest, it's all the same to me. For all I know, you are either a god... Or just a voice in my head. That, too, doesn't really matter. Because you're there. And that means the world to me. Alright. Time for me to go back. I wonder how many fingers they've left intact. Man, that shit is going to hurt for months... Then again, what's a few broken bones for an entire city? And besides... I think it's time for everyone to find out, anyway. Including you, of course! 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Wakey wakey! 
HUMAN: ... Daph? 
HUMAN: I missed you. How are you holding up? 
HUMAN: I'm not sure what kind of answer you're expecting. But I'm alright, I guess. 
HUMAN: Glad to hear it. 
HUMAN: So? What's on the menu? 
HUMAN: Well, I'm happy you enjoyed the appetizer. And I think we're both ready for the main course. 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: Hello, Ganymede. 
HUMAN: How nice of you to join in on the fun! Ouch... That one actually hurt, you know. 
RESPONSE: Shut up! 
HUMAN: Or what? 
RESPONSE: For the record... I'm sorry. 
HUMAN: Nice try! But that won't work anymore. Come on Gany. Look. At him. Hello? 
HUMAN: !!! What the fuck?! 
HUMAN: Awww. There you are! 
RESPONSE: Tell me. Where is he? 
HUMAN: Jesus fucking christ! How do you think I would know?! 
RESPONSE: Answer. 
HUMAN: I don't know! !! 
HUMAN: Three down... Seven to go. I hope you'll last through all of them. You know what comes after that, right? 
HUMAN: Steady. Breathe. And go! It worked? Good stuff. Funny. Damn. I was hoping I could buy us a bit more time. Anyways, I'm sorry for putting you through this. But for some weird reason, I seem to pull you into this place with me. And I think you can understand... That I'd rather be here than there, right now. But let's forget about that for a moment, okay? So tell me, what's on your mind? Alright, I gotta go back. But don't worry. I think it's time for everyone to find out, anyway. Including you, of course! Come on. I don't know how many hours we've spent together, by now. And you know a lot more about me than I know about you. It's a shame, really. I wish we could interact more. As I said... It's my safe haven. The place I call home. Normally, I'd be alone here. But for some reason you're with me. Why, I wonder... Yeah, they're really working me. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. These two are feared for a reason. I'm sorry. But for now, we got to live with it. If everything goes right... The two of us will have a lot of time to talk. Hmm... I think you're right. Really? You're already running out of topics? In all seriousness, though... I'm glad you're with me. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: We're done with him. 
HUMAN: I should go and see Lily. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Wait. 
RESPONSE: Hm? 
HUMAN: There's something I got to ask you. 
RESPONSE: Go ahead. 
HUMAN: What De Bloom said about you and Eury... Is it true? 
RESPONSE: Yeah. I found her. 
HUMAN: Why did you never mention it? 
RESPONSE: I told you that I'd protect her. 
HUMAN: Even if she's a traitor? 
RESPONSE: You know I don't really care about that. 
HUMAN: Let's try another angle, then. What if she's responsible for the Lorna thing? 
RESPONSE: I'll kill her. 
HUMAN: Can't say I agree with your motives. But alright. 
RESPONSE: Anything else? 
HUMAN: Nope. I'm good. 
RESPONSE: Okay. Let's go and see Gany. 
HUMAN: Right. He's in the archives, down in the basement. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Atlas. 
RESPONSE: Orpheus. 
HUMAN: Eury. 
HUMAN: Daph. 
HUMAN: Now that we're all here. Let's talk terms. 
HUMAN: You think so? I was rather hoping you'd put up more of a fight. 
HUMAN: Sorry to disappoint you. But there's no need for me to resist. You've got my brother, don't you? 
HUMAN: What's left of him, anyway. 
HUMAN: I figured as much. So... What do you want? 
HUMAN: Well, for starters... You're gonna come with us. We'll haul both of you back to Ionia. And then, we'll squeeze every little detail out of you, your precious little brother... And that bitch of yours. 
HUMAN: Oh my. So confident. Reminds me of myself when I was your age. 
HUMAN: With one key difference... I never lost. 
HUMAN: Really? Are you sure about that? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: I see. That is... disappointing. But it doesn't change anything. 
HUMAN: That's right. You'll join him, soon, anyway. 
HUMAN: I don't think so. 
HUMAN: Really? And why would that be? 
HUMAN: You still grasped it? You're outnumbered. 
HUMAN: I can count well enough, thank you very much. 
RESPONSE: Put it down, Daph. 
HUMAN: Atlas? 
RESPONSE: Sorry. But I mean it. 
HUMAN: This isn't funny. 
RESPONSE: It isn't. Drop it, now! 
HUMAN: Why? 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN:
RESPONSE: He set it all up. From start to finish. Every piece of the puzzle, right there... Apart from one thing. How did Hyperion know that Lorna wanted to run away? I had no clue. And neither did Eury. Lorna never told any of us. Did she? 
HUMAN: Hm. You got me right there. It's weird isn't it? She made me promise not to tell either of you. You know why? Because as much as both of you loved her... You never really listened to anything she said. Of all the people in the world... I was the only one who knew what she was going through. And yeah. I told Hyperion. 
RESPONSE: What did you tell him? 
HUMAN: That Lorna wanted to get away from it all. 
RESPONSE: And what did he say? 
HUMAN: I'm sure we can find a way to fix all this. 
RESPONSE: Daph. You know the story, now. The sides are set. And the masks are dropped. I'll give you a choice. Join us, and we'll make him pay. 
HUMAN: Atlas. I meant what I said. There's no one on this world I love more than you. You saved me from a monster. But Hyperion picked me up. He showed me something I'm good at. And I'm not willing to give that up for a person who's been dead for more than four years. 
RESPONSE: Alright. Then leave. 
HUMAN: What? 
RESPONSE: Go and tell Hyperion... I'm coming for him. 
HUMAN: Are you having a laugh? There's no way I'll let the three of you off, like that. 
RESPONSE: You're welcome to try. But I'd rather not waste any time, if I were you. 
HUMAN: Oh? And why would that be? 
RESPONSE: You never read Solka's letter, did you? 
HUMAN: Should I? 
RESPONSE: I don't think there's any need for that. Not for you, at least. But for everyone who doesn't know... I'm sure they'll appreciate all the details behind what happened, back then. 
HUMAN: What?! 
RESPONSE: You heard me. It's public knowledge, now. 
HUMAN: Are you insane? If Amryn gets wind of that- 
RESPONSE: They'll declare war on Ionia. 
HUMAN: You'd go this far, just for her? 
HUMAN: She was right, you know. Ionia is a monstrosity. 
HUMAN: As if Amryn were any better. 
RESPONSE: Who said anything about Amryn? 
HUMAN: Huh? Who's paying your bills then? 
HUMAN: No one. You said it yourself. People like us can't help ourselves. Just like this city... We want to be free. 
HUMAN: This just gets better and better. You think you can cause a war and get away with it? The entire IIS will be up your arse in a week! 
RESPONSE: We'll see about that. Just keep in mind that we have a list. And your name's on it, too. 
HUMAN: Now that's more like it. Alright, let's have it your way. 
RESPONSE: Sorry, Daph. It's nothing personal. 
HUMAN: Right. I'll remind you of that when I come back and put this city to the torch. 
RESPONSE: Feel free to. Not today, though. 
HUMAN: Yeah. Not today. 
RESPONSE:

HUMAN: Damn. I missed... 
RESPONSE: Eury! 
HUMAN: I'll go and fetch a doctor! 
HUMAN: Don't bother. I think I'm done for, anyway. 
RESPONSE: Don't say that. I refuse to let you go. 
HUMAN: It's a bit late for that, isn't it? But I do appreciate the sentiment. 
RESPONSE: Stop the melodramatic bullshit, already! You'll live, you hear me?! 
HUMAN: Thank you for everything, the two of you. And don't worry about me, too much. After all these years... I can finally apologize to her. 
HUMAN: Atlas! Don't. We'll need her. 
RESPONSE: You're right. Don't wait for me. 

HUMAN: Shit! 
RESPONSE: What's wrong? 
HUMAN: Did you see my pants anywhere? 
RESPONSE: Seriously? 
HUMAN: This isn't funny, you know. I gotta be at the barracks in thirty minutes. 
RESPONSE: Did you have a look under the bed, yet? 
HUMAN: Of course I di- Actually... Phew. 
RESPONSE: See? 
HUMAN: Hm. This is bad. 
RESPONSE: What? 
HUMAN: My service card's not in here. 
RESPONSE: Hm. You think you left it at home? 
HUMAN: Probably, yeah. You know if Eury is back in Aion? 
RESPONSE: I'm not sure. But I think so, yeah. 
HUMAN: Fuck. I'd rather not run across her, right now. 
RESPONSE: Did you have another argument? 
HUMAN: Right before she left, yeah. 
RESPONSE: I see. Want me to go and fetch your stuff for you? 
HUMAN: Nah, it's fine. Seeing you might just rile her up even more. 
RESPONSE:
