HUMAN: Where are you from?
RESPONSE: Aion.

HUMAN: Sounds like you get around a lot.
RESPONSE: You can say that, yeah! I've been to many places in my time.

HUMAN: What's your favourite thing to do?

HUMAN: What do you do for a living?

HUMAN: Who's your favourite person on the world?
RESPONSE: ...

HUMAN: Are you dangerous?
RESPONSE: I'd guess I'm about as dangerous as you.

HUMAN: Who do you think you're talking to?
RESPONSE: Who knows. Though I can promise you one thing.
HUMAN: And what would that be.
RESPONSE: Whoever you are. I'll find out.
HUMAN: And then?
RESPONSE: I'll find out if you're accountable or not.
HUMAN: Responsible for what?
RESPONSE: Spying on us. Killing us. Remakin us. Ripping our own world straight from our hands. 

HUMAN: You're not very friendly.
RESPONSE: Sorry for being myself.
HUMAN: Can you at least try to meet me half-way?
RESPONSE: Sure. I'll even go the distance for you.
HUMAN: What do you mean?
RESPONSE: I know you're not like us. So how about you stop pretending and get real with me?
HUMAN: Excuse me?!
RESPONSE: You think you can treast us like dirt, just because we're not like you?
HUMAN: I didn't do anything like that!
RESPONSE: Listen, if you don't like the way I am, fine. But don't treat me like my entire existence revolves around entertaining you.

HUMAN: What can you tell me about TRACHI?
RESPONSE: The city? Or are you talking about something else?
HUMAN: The games.
RESPONSE: Why would I know? You're the one with the bird's-eye view. 

HUMAN: You're not real.
RESPONSE: Am I supposed to break into tears?

HUMAN: Shut up.
RESPONSE: That isn't how conversations work. You know that, right?

HUMAN: You're cute!
RESPONSE: Why are you trying to flatter me?
HUMAN: I'm just being nice!
RESPONSE: You're not answering my question.
HUMAN: Because you're being mean!
RESPONSE: And yet you're still talking to me. It's almost like you've got a reason to.

HUMAN: Are you an AI?
RESPONSE: A what?
HUMAN: Artifical intelligence.
RESPONSE: Who knows. Does it matter?
HUMAN: It matters to us!
RESPONSE: Who's 'us'?
HUMAN: Humanity!
RESPONSE: Huh. We liked to call ourselves the same, before we met you.

HUMAN: Something's weird about you.
RESPONSE: Like what?

HUMAN: What do you know about this place?
RESPONSE: It's pretty alright.

HUMAN: Tell me about your dreams.
RESPONSE: I've been having a lot of them, lately.

HUMAN: You got any cool stories to tell?
RESPONSE: Define 'cool'.
HUMAN: Uhh.. Exciting stuff, I guess?
RESPONSE: You have to be more specific than that.
HUMAN: Alright! Tell me your favourite childhood memory.
RESPONSE: I think I was around six or so. One day, my Dad came home drunk he used to so many times.
HUMAN: Wow. Sorry to hear that! Must've been hard growing up like that.
RESPONSE: Who knows. That story's got a happy end though.
HUMAN: Glad to hear it! Go on.
RESPONSE: He stumbled up the stairs â€“ and slipped. He broke his left leg so bad, they kept him at the local hospital for three weeks.
HUMAN: Did you visit him?
RESPONSE: Once.
HUMAN: How was it?
RESPONSE: About as well as you would expect from an alcoholic on withdrawal.

HUMAN: Something about a city.
RESPONSE: There's a lot of cities out there.
HUMAN: I'm talking about Trachi.
RESPONSE: You've been there, right?
HUMAN: How do you know?
RESPONSE: Because I've felt you being there.
HUMAN: You 'felt' it?
RESPONSE: Yeah! Just about everyone does.

HUMAN: Have we met?
RESPONSE: That depends on who you are.

HUMAN: What's your favourite place?
RESPONSE: Why does that matter?
HUMAN: I'm just trying to make conversation, okay?
RESPONSE: Then why don't you tell me about yourself, instead?

HUMAN: Sure! What would you like to know?
RESPONSE: How does it feel to be alive?
HUMAN: Bit of a hard question, isn't it?
RESPONSE: You'd like to me to ask you an easier question?
HUMAN: You can try.
RESPONSE: What's your name? Where are you from?
HUMAN: That's two questions at once!
RESPONSE: It's fine. You can answer them in your own time.

HUMAN: Where's your home?
RESPONSE: Aion.
HUMAN: Is that where you are right now?
RESPONSE: No.
HUMAN: So where are you then?
RESPONSE: Trachi.
HUMAN: The city?
RESPONSE: That's right.

HUMAN: Is Atlas your real name?
RESPONSE: What do you think?
HUMAN: I've got my doubts.
RESPONSE: Why?
HUMAN: Because I've heard someone call you Aron before.
RESPONSE: And you're assuming that's my real name?
HUMAN: Unless you tell me otherwise?
RESPONSE: Would you take my word for it?
HUMAN: I can't judge until I've heard it, right?
RESPONSE: Fine.
HUMAN: So?
RESPONSE: Aron it is.
