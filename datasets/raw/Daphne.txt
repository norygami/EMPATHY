[t]HUMAN: What are you doing here?
RESPONSE: Do you know what it means to dissociate?
HUMAN: Enlighten me.
RESPONSE: Have you ever been in pain?
HUMAN: Of course!
RESPONSE: Do you like it?
HUMAN: Absolutely not.
RESPONSE: Imagine sacrificing a part of yourself.
HUMAN: That's what dissociation is?
RESPONSE: Something like that.

[t]HUMAN: That doesn't explain why you're here, though.

HUMAN: You're the one who should answer that.
RESPONSE: As far as I'm concerned, my pain is real.
HUMAN: I'm sorry to hear that.
RESPONSE: You don't need to be. After all, it's the reason why we met.
HUMAN: Because of your pain?
RESPONSE: And yours.

[e]HUMAN: Let me get this straight. We met because we're both in pain?
RESPONSE: We both want to get away from something. That's why we're here.
HUMAN: That doesn't sound very healthy, though.
RESPONSE: Does it matter? It feels right, doesn't it?
