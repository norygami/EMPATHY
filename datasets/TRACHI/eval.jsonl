You're trying to turn Anton against me!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I didn't do anything like that. You pushed him away all by yourself."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How dare you! I'm taking him home now. And there's nothing you can do about it. Ouch! What the fuck! You stupid little..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stop it! You're hurting him! W-what?! Let me go!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm sorry, Timo. But it's his dog."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NO!!! You little shit!"}]}

Do you like it, so far?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hm. You really think he's worth all that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Silly girl. I told you I'm not in this for someone else. All I care about... Is to see things burn. So how about it? Want me to put a stop to it?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You really enjoy this, don't you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Am I supposed to feel guilty for that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not at all. On the contrary... You did everything just the way we wanted you to."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Really? I think you're bluffing, Daph."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I thought you might say that. It just fits you so perfectly well. And since you're trying so hard to keep that mask of yours up... I'm going to enjoy this even more than I thought! You like to see things burn, you said. There's about twenty to thirty armed men outside. God... The suspense is killing me. Alright. Here we go."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You wouldn't dare."}]}

You need something from the Colonel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, tough luck. He left like an hour ago."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Damn."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Say, have we met before?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not that I can think of."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hm... Might just be my mind playing tricks on me, then. In any case... I'm Herbert."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Theodore."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You want me to relay a message to the Colonel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks, but it's fine. I don't mind waiting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Alright. I'll get back to work, then."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't let me keep you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was nice meeting you, Theodore. I totally forgot! I'm terribly sorry... But we've been having an influx on new people, lately. So the Colonel asked me to conduct a check on all the personnel."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Would you mind showing me your identification, real quick?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not at all."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you. Let's see... Theodore Harrington... Wait a second... Are you related to Freddy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Freddy?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Frederick Harrington. Tall, blonde guy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh! No, I don't think so. At the very least, I never met him."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay then. You're from Trachi proper?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Born and raised."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh-huh. That's quite curious."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How so?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, your accent reminds me a bit of the countryside."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Is that so? The truth is... Both of my parents are from Verin. They moved here a few years before I was born."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh! That explains it. Hm... When were these papers issued?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uhh... I don't remember the exact date. But it must've been a week, or two ago."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hmm. I might be wrong... But looks like the identification is based on an old numbering system. I'm sorry, but I'll have to check up on this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Would you come with me, please?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well... I'm not sure the Colonel would appreciate my report being delayed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No need to worry about that. Should just take a moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright... If you insist."}]}

I'm not sure I recognize you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Corporal Harrington, sir. You wanted my report on the Staffold case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. Well then, corporal. Follow me."}]}
{"chat": [{"role": "system", "content": "Ganymede"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So... I take it you're the man from the IIS?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yup."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Good. I'm sorry about the circumstances of this meeting. But unfortunately, there's a lot of eyes directed towards me, lately."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't worry about it. Though I think it's best if we get straight to the point."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Agreed. I'll be frank with you... There's a wide a range of influential people trying to replace me. After what happened at the checkpoint yesterday... A considerable number of Guardsmen have been reposted from the outskirts to the urban branches. Among them there's a Lieutenant, which, from what I know, you've already met."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I see where this is going. In fact... He's one of the reasons why I'm here."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm glad we're on the same page, then. In any case... Here's his file. Unfortunately, it won't tell you much you don't already know. So let me add the following remarks... Lieutenant Tanner is a brute. But not without a sense of shrewdness. That, and his ability to establish political contacts... Made him gather a sizeable herd of loyal servicemen. Mostly from his own branch, working the checkpoints. But his popularity, even within the urban sections, has grown exponentially."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There was another man... Heinrich, if I recall correctly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A good man. But far too ideological. Freedom fighters don't always make good politicians. Some of them are far too stuck in their own beliefs... And would rather let someone else take charge. Heinrich refused to encourage unorthodox ways of policing. And held up high the ideal of a valiant, uncorruptable Guardsman. This made him somewhat unpopular with certain parts of the Guard. Tanner only had to swoop down and take the opportunity. Supported by the mayor, of course. Who was very keen on the prospect of gaining a more or less loyal asset within the Guard. Lieutenant Tanner... Is a pragmatist. Of course, he proclaims that it's all for the good of the city. That it's time for Trachi to enter the world stage as a force to be reckoned with. It's tomfoolery of absurd proportions. But it works."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How dependent is he on Faber?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "He still needs him, of course. But that's not to say he wouldn't serve someone else, if the opportunity presents itself. In other words... If you want to hit Tanner, you can't simply do this through his host. You need to strike at him directly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright. His address is still the same?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "From what I know."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Say... Would you mind if I showed you something?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Something you should definitely see for yourself. If you'd be so kind and follow me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not here to play games, you know."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I am aware of that. It won't take long."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll take your word for it."}]}
