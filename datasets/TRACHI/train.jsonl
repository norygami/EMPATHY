I think it's adorable in some way. And I can definitely emphasize with it. It'll do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is that a yes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yup. I'll try!

It's what she does."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe. Or maybe you just want to keep things pretty... Before you smash them to bits."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're really something else, Atlas. It's like you're incredibly clever... But also insurmountably stupid, at the same time.
